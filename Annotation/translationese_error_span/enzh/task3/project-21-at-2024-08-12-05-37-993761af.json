Mountains (33 percent), plateaus (26 percent) and hills (10 percent) account for nearly 70 percent of the country's land surface. Most of the country's arable land and population are based in lowland plains (12 percent) and basins (19 percent), though some of the greatest basins are filled with deserts. The country's rugged terrain presents problems for the construction of overland transportation infrastructure and requires extensive terracing to sustain agriculture, but is conducive to the development of forestry, mineral and hydropower resources, as well as tourism in the country.","translation":"中国政府将中国的地形划分为五个同质性的物理宏观区域，即华东地区（包括东北平原、华北平原和南方丘陵）、新疆-蒙古地区以及西藏高原。这里地形多样，包括雪-capped高山、深奥的河谷、广袤的盆地、高耸的高原、起伏的平原、梯田山丘、沙漠沙丘等众多地理特征和各种陆地形态。一般而言，国土西部地势较高，向东海岸逐渐倾斜。山地（33％）、高原（26％）和丘陵（10％）占据了中国国土面积的近70%。大部分可耕地和人口聚集在低地平原（12％）和盆地（19％），尽管一些最大的盆地已被沙漠填满。中国崎岖的地形给陆路交通基础设施的建设带来了挑战，需要大规模的梯田来支持农业，但也为林业、矿产和水力资源开发，以及国家旅游业的发展提供了有利条件。","src":"wiki","idx":793,"type":"gpt-3.5-turbo_ctx_pivot","src_v1":"wiki","words_num":206,"batch_idx":26},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-07-23T01:50:15.297610Z","updated_at":"2024-07-24T05:28:07.862486Z","inner_id":27,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":21,"updated_by":8,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":15770,"annotations":[{"id":3364,"completed_by":8,"result":[{"value":{"start":356,"end":378,"text":"并强烈批评美国社会中所谓的“白人权力结构”。","labels":["Mistranslations"]},"id":"FATWy3FUAS","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-07-24T05:29:35.900308Z","updated_at":"2024-07-24T05:38:48.175349Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":110.831,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"aa4b48b3-1fb3-41a8-a59e-b4ddab2eff49","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":15770,"project":21,"updated_by":8,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null},{"id":3877,"completed_by":8,"result":[{"value":{"start":176,"end":191,"text":"并将他与托马斯·杰斐逊相比较。","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"qwjegLPxdI","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-07-27T17:06:00.792733Z","updated_at":"2024-07-27T17:06:08.394391Z","draft_created_at":"2024-07-24T05:29:54.203415Z","lead_time":25.858,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"addddb3c-e7f6-4093-9997-40e5b316d3aa","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":15770,"project":21,"updated_by":8,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"a855236f-task_3.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"In a 1965 letter to his friend Paul Semonin, Thompson explained an affection for the Industrial Workers of the World, \"I have in recent months come to have a certain feeling for Joe Hill and the Wobbly crowd who, if nothing else, had the right idea.

In the 18th and 19th century, tuberculosis had become epidemic in Europe, showing a seasonal pattern. Tuberculosis caused widespread public concern in the 19th and early 20th centuries as the disease became common among the urban poor. In 1815, one in four deaths in England was due to \"consumption\". By 1918, TB still caused one in six deaths in France. After TB was determined to be contagious, in the 1880s, it was put on a notifiable-disease list in Britain; campaigns started to stop people from spitting in public places, and the infected poor were \"encouraged\" to enter sanatoria that resembled prisons (the sanatoria for the middle and upper classes offered excellent care and constant medical attention).

Our analysis suggests that focal loss reduces the curvature of the loss surface in training the model. This indicates that curvature may be one of the essential factors in achieving model calibration. We design numerical experiments to support this conjecture to reveal the behavior of focal loss and the relationship between calibration performance and curvature.","translation":"在决策场景中实施机器学习算法的关键因素不仅是模型的准确性，还包括其置信水平。在分类问题中，模型的置信水平通常通过softmax函数的输出向量来表示方便。然而，这些值已知会显著偏离实际期望的模型置信水平。这个问题被称为模型校准，已得到广泛研究。其中，最简单的技术之一是焦点损失，通过引入一个正参数来推广交叉熵。尽管由于该想法的简单性和形式化，在此方面存在许多相关研究，但对其行为的理论分析仍然不够。在本研究中，我们的目标是通过几何重新解释焦点损失的功能来理解其行为。我们的分析表明，焦点损失减少了训练模型中损失曲面的曲率。这表明曲率可能是实现模型校准的基本因素之一。我们设计了数值实验来支持这一假设，以揭示焦点损失的行为和校准性能与曲率之间的关系。","src":"arxiv-ai","idx":73,"type":"gpt-3.5-turbo_end2end","src_v1":"arxiv","words_num":204,"batch_idx":134},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-07-23T01:50:15.310800Z","updated_at":"2024-07-24T14:53:51.861503Z","inner_id":135,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":21,"updated_by":8,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":15878,"annotations":[{"id":3546,"completed_by":8,"result":[{"value":{"start":26,"end":38,"text":"尽管它们的行为似乎很残忍","labels":["Mistranslations"]},"id":"T7wfHYncUu","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-07-24T14:54:36.833004Z","updated_at":"2024-07-24T14:54:36.833040Z","draft_created_at":"2024-07-24T14:54:23.044242Z","lead_time":43.44,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"1080e999-695c-4847-979a-6bd8bec3793d","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":15878,"project":21,"updated_by":8,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"a855236f-task_3.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"But what gradually emerges, going along, is that the replicants aren't the monsters.
