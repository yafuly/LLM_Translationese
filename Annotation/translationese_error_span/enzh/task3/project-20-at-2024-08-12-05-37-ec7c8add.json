In the 18th and 19th century, tuberculosis had become epidemic in Europe, showing a seasonal pattern. Tuberculosis caused widespread public concern in the 19th and early 20th centuries as the disease became common among the urban poor. In 1815, one in four deaths in England was due to \"consumption\". By 1918, TB still caused one in six deaths in France. After TB was determined to be contagious, in the 1880s, it was put on a notifiable-disease list in Britain; campaigns started to stop people from spitting in public places, and the infected poor were \"encouraged\" to enter sanatoria that resembled prisons (the sanatoria for the middle and upper classes offered excellent care and constant medical attention).

I got a medium in both the top and bottom and I never once worry about popping out. It's completely family-friendly. I'm at the point now that when I want a truly comfortable bikini, this is the one I always reach for. — Rachel Lubitz, former senior lifestyle editor","translation":"我对这套泳衣赞不绝口，已经穿了一年多了。对我这样胸围较大的人（我是32H）来说，找到合适的比基尼是一大挑战，但这套泳衣的面料宽松，上衣部分不可思议地既能遮住又合身。我上下都买的中码，从来不担心会走光。这套泳衣非常适合家庭使用。现在，每当我想要一件真正舒适的比基尼时，我总是首选它。 —— 瑞秋·卢比兹，前高级生活方式编辑","src":"cnn-news","idx":377,"type":"gpt-4-turbo_end2end","src_v1":"cnn","words_num":118,"batch_idx":98},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-07-23T01:49:28.989702Z","updated_at":"2024-07-24T08:49:13.539265Z","inner_id":99,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":20,"updated_by":11,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":15662,"annotations":[{"id":3418,"completed_by":11,"result":[{"value":{"start":20,"end":31,"text":"他在最后40米似乎加速","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"LOOstTCHeT","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":158,"end":176,"text":"他可能有能力保持同样的速度超过80米","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"pIsIn54k22","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":34,"end":47,"text":"在最后20米进行一种胜利舞","labels":["Unnatural Phrase Flow"]},"id":"BSKxKZqegm","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-07-24T08:59:35.351906Z","updated_at":"2024-07-25T06:27:34.831627Z","draft_created_at":"2024-07-24T08:59:11.717586Z","lead_time":45.224,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"a5831d38-2346-457e-932a-ee731adba63f","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":15662,"project":20,"updated_by":11,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"0b4cf0e3-task_3.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"That’s why you see in most of his races it seems like he accelerates in the last 40 m and then does a sort of victory dance in the last 20m.

An analysis of the effects of continual pre-training revealed that it was particularly effective for Japanese question answering tasks. Furthermore, to elucidate effective methodologies for cross-lingual continual pre-training from English to Japanese, we investigated the impact of vocabulary expansion and the effectiveness of incorporating parallel corpora. The results showed that the efficiency gained through vocabulary expansion had no negative impact on performance, except for the summarization task, and that the combined use of parallel corpora enhanced translation ability.","translation":"跨语言连续预训练大语言模型（LLMs），初步在英文资源集合上训练，可以帮助我们充分利用英语语言资源，并降低预训练成本。在本研究中，我们构建了一款具有增强了日语功能的LLM，称为Swallow，通过扩展Llama 2的词表包含日文字符，并在大型日文网络资源上进行连续预训练来实现此目的。实验结果表明，通过连续预训练，日语任务的表现显著提高，并且表现随着训练数据量的增加而逐渐增加，直到达到100B tokens。因此，Swallow表现优于从头开始在英文和日文上训练的其他LLMs。对连续预训练的影响分析表明，它尤其有效于日语问答任务。为了理解从英文到日文的跨语言连续预训练有效方法，我们研究了扩展词表的影响和并行语料的有效性。结果表明，扩展词表的效率没有影响表现，除了摘要任务以外，并行语料的合并可以提高翻译能力。","src":"arxiv-ai","idx":151,"type":"mistral_trans","src_v1":"arxiv","words_num":205,"batch_idx":152},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-07-23T01:49:28.995355Z","updated_at":"2024-07-25T02:32:59.641789Z","inner_id":153,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":20,"updated_by":11,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":15716,"annotations":[{"id":3743,"completed_by":11,"result":[{"value":{"start":129,"end":167,"text":"所以坐在那里用纸盘和塑料餐具就餐时，感到特别不安，而其他人却享用着盘子和银具","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"zN2yE0ciAt","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-07-25T02:36:19.463957Z","updated_at":"2024-07-25T02:44:47.773733Z","draft_created_at":"2024-07-25T02:35:34.605115Z","lead_time":149.843,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"96ccb909-c88d-43f5-9103-8e5cec865538","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":15716,"project":20,"updated_by":11,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"0b4cf0e3-task_3.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"A couple minutes before dinner, I went to wash my hands and came back and everyone was seated in their chairs at the dinner table with china, silverware and glasses.
