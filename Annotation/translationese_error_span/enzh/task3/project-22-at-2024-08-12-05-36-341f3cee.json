In 1815, one in four deaths in England was due to \"consumption\". By 1918, TB still caused one in six deaths in France. After TB was determined to be contagious, in the 1880s, it was put on a notifiable-disease list in Britain; campaigns started to stop people from spitting in public places, and the infected poor were \"encouraged\" to enter sanatoria that resembled prisons (the sanatoria for the middle and upper classes offered excellent care and constant medical attention). Whatever the benefits of the \"fresh air\" and labor in the sanatoria, even under the best conditions, 50% of those who entered died within five years ( 1916).","translation":"在欧洲，1600年代初，肺炎的发病率开始上升，直到1800年代，它造成了近乎25%的所有死亡。在18世纪和19世纪，肺炎在欧洲已经成为了流行病，显示出季节性模式。在19世纪和早期20世纪，由于肺炎成为了城市贫民的常见病症，在公众中引起了广泛的关注。1815年，英国每四死一人都是因为“消瘦”死亡的。直到1918年，在法国，肺炎仍然导致一六死一人。当肺炎被确定为传染性疾病时，在1880年代，在英国就将其列为可报告疾病；开始在公共地方禁止吐腐殖，并“鼓励”感染者入住像监狱一样的病房（中上层人士的病房则提供了优质的照护和不断的医疗关注）。无论在最好的条件下，50%的入院者在五年内死亡（1916年）。","src":"wiki","idx":636,"type":"mistral_trans","src_v1":"wiki","words_num":201,"batch_idx":71},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-07-23T01:50:58.580830Z","updated_at":"2024-07-26T02:25:44.831597Z","inner_id":72,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":22,"updated_by":6,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":15995,"annotations":[{"id":3634,"completed_by":6,"result":[{"value":{"start":35,"end":56,"text":"检测深度仿冒视频的方法主要集中在解压视频上","labels":["Unnatural Phrase Flow"]},"id":"DOK00ujXk8","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":227,"end":237,"text":"基于轨迹空间运动轨迹","labels":["Unnatural Phrase Flow"]},"id":"PyKzBNySvR","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":311,"end":349,"text":"我们通过计算视频压缩前后面部关键点的一致分布来验证设计得很好的特征的鲁棒性。","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"5mefoQzObP","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":349,"end":359,"text":"我们的方法表现得很好","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"ux_uQG-c6b","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-07-25T01:10:24.377352Z","updated_at":"2024-07-25T01:10:24.377385Z","draft_created_at":"2024-07-25T01:08:01.777342Z","lead_time":151.757,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"7829bedc-90cc-4709-9ffa-698811a2bf5a","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":15995,"project":22,"updated_by":6,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"c705b580-task_3.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"The misuse of deepfake technology by malicious actors poses a potential threat to nations, societies, and individuals.
