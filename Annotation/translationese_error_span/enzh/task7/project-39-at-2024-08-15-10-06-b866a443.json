However, it is often considered as a separate subtask from downstream applications such as classification, regression, or clustering, and thus is not optimized together with them. We hypothesize that treating the imputation model and downstream task model together and optimizing over full pipelines will yield better results than treating them separately. Our work describes a novel AutoML technique for making downstream predictions with missing data that automatically handles preprocessing, model weighting, and selection during inference time, with minimal compute overhead. Specifically we develop M-DEW, a Dynamic missingness-aware Ensemble Weighting (DEW) approach, that constructs a set of two-stage imputation-prediction pipelines, trains each component separately, and dynamically calculates a set of pipeline weights for each sample during inference time. We thus extend previous work on dynamic ensemble weighting to handle missing data at the level of full imputation-prediction pipelines, improving performance and calibration on downstream machine learning tasks over standard model averaging techniques.

Table food is not a balanced diet and where it really makes a difference is when they are young and growing and need a balanced diet to achieve their optimum health and growth, and when they are older and start to develop kidney disease, liver disease, or other problems which REQUIRE restricted protein, fat, and other things. By then, all they will eat is table food and forcing a switch back to a beneficial diet like Hills Science Diet becomes impossible after years of eating from the table.","translation":"当我们喂宠物吃餐桌上的食物时，看到它们双眼放大，尾巴摇摆，表现出兴奋和喜悦的样子，每个人都会感到开心。但餐桌食物的问题在于，一小口很容易就变成一大块，然后变成一小碗，最后变成它们的常规食物。餐桌食物不是一种均衡的饮食，而这在它们年幼、正在成长并需要均衡饮食以达到最佳健康和成长状态时，以及当它们年老开始患有肾病、肝病或其他需要限制蛋白质、脂肪等摄入的疾病时，尤其重要。到那时，它们只愿意吃餐桌食物，而强制它们转换回像希尔's科学饮食这样有益的饮食，多年的餐桌饮食习惯之后将变得不可能。","src":"quora_foods","idx":470,"type":"gpt-4-turbo_end2end","src_v1":"quora","words_num":149,"batch_idx":125},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-08-12T03:16:07.662010Z","updated_at":"2024-08-13T08:53:34.135186Z","inner_id":126,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":39,"updated_by":11,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":18083,"annotations":[{"id":5704,"completed_by":11,"result":[{"value":{"start":26,"end":58,"text":"这些药物有可能成为改变千百万美国人患有2型糖尿病和肥胖问题的良药","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"nPSG2dJwHf","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":116,"end":122,"text":"起到任何好处","labels":["Unnatural Phrase Flow"]},"id":"rfEFS8B0R7","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":147,"end":175,"text":"使联邦医疗保险、医疗补助以及整个医疗保健系统陷入破产之中","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"DnDwQAG7eq","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":177,"end":202,"text":"桑德斯是参议院卫生、教育、劳工及养老金委员会主席。","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"NTVygpDnu-","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":0,"end":25,"text":"诺和诺德科学家们为研发出这些药物而应得到极大的称赞","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"jyJSMFMEem","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":96,"end":110,"text":"那些无力承担费用的千百万患者","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"qvSzp0t6Hf","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-08-13T09:03:51.571556Z","updated_at":"2024-08-15T06:47:25.908731Z","draft_created_at":"2024-08-13T09:03:24.277178Z","lead_time":327.13999999999993,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"1543bdeb-3aec-43fa-a496-6bfdc38f6566","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":18083,"project":39,"updated_by":11,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"f89d6813-task_7.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"“The scientists at Novo Nordisk deserve great credit for developing these drugs that have the potential to be a game changer for millions of Americans struggling with type 2 diabetes and obesity.

To address this, we introduce a new Vietnamese multimodal dataset, named ViMACSA, which consists of 4,876 text-image pairs with 14,618 fine-grained annotations for both text and image in the hotel domain. Additionally, we propose a Fine-Grained Cross-Modal Fusion Framework (FCMF) that effectively learns both intra- and inter-modality interactions and then fuses these information to produce a unified multimodal representation. Experimental results show that our framework outperforms SOTA models on the ViMACSA dataset, achieving the highest F1 score of 79.73%. We also explore characteristics and challenges in Vietnamese multimodal sentiment analysis, including misspellings, abbreviations, and the complexities of the Vietnamese language. This work contributes both a benchmark dataset and a new framework that leverages fine-grained multimodal information to improve multimodal aspect-category sentiment analysis.
