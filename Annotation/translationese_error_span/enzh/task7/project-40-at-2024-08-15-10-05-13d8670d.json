Finally, we discuss ideas to allow more controlled LLM creativity, rather than relying on chance via changing the temperature parameter.","translation":"大规模语言模型（LLM）在各种创造性任务中都有着广泛的应用，其输出的内容从美丽到怪异再到著名的复制粘贴作品都有，而且这些作品的质量各有不同。因此，很多人将温度参数称为创造力的参数，因为该参数可调节随机性程度，从而导致输出的形式多样化。在本文中，我们将通过一项定义了预先确定的语言背景、模型和激励语句的故事创作任务来考察这一假设。我们的研究发现，温度参数与创造性的四个必要条件之间存在弱相关性：新颖性、典型性、连贯性和协调性。温度参数与新颖性的相关性很弱，但与协调性和连贯性的相关性都较强，但与典型性的相关性却是微弱的。然而，温度参数对创造性的影响并不像“创造力参数”这一说法所暗示的那样简单明了，而且影响力并不强。总体来说，随着温度的升高，LLM输出的内容变得更加新颖。最后，我们讨论了如何通过减少随机性的方式来控制LLM的创造性，而不是完全依靠温度参数。","src":"arxiv-ai","idx":66,"type":"alma_13B_trans","src_v1":"arxiv","words_num":209,"batch_idx":26},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-08-12T03:16:29.853172Z","updated_at":"2024-08-12T11:37:57.794821Z","inner_id":27,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":40,"updated_by":14,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":18164,"annotations":[{"id":5559,"completed_by":14,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":29,"text":"去中心化学习（DL）通过在不涉及中心聚合的情况下分布式训练","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"XyercvWjgI","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":81,"end":85,"text":"存在挑战","labels":["Unnatural Phrase Flow"]},"id":"_f0wQ4dnBT","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":165,"end":169,"text":"额外障碍","labels":["Unnatural Phrase Flow"]},"id":"2AcVi0BtPU","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":329,"end":345,"text":"包括最多有1000个客户端的场景","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"T-OmlaFpfa","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":346,"end":398,"text":"评估显示我们的协议显著优于传统方法，尤其是在客户端掉线率高达30％和模型大小达到$10^6$参数的情况下","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"_rHkpIs_en","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":133,"end":135,"text":"侵害","labels":["Unnatural Phrase Flow"]},"id":"TbSClwBncP","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":226,"end":235,"text":"来保护隐私的 DL","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"MoaxVmvZc5","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-08-12T11:45:49.075855Z","updated_at":"2024-08-12T12:40:39.493481Z","draft_created_at":"2024-08-12T11:39:55.275944Z","lead_time":516.174,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"6020691c-bc6b-4e2e-ad40-ff2cc1a2dfed","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":18164,"project":40,"updated_by":14,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"8d28d4d8-task_7.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"Decentralized learning (DL) offers a novel paradigm in machine learning by distributing training across clients without central aggregation, enhancing scalability and efficiency.
