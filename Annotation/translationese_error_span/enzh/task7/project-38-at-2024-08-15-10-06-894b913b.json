We compare our protocols with traditional secret-sharing solutions across scenarios, including those with up to 1000 clients. Evaluations show that our protocols significantly outperform conventional methods, especially in scenarios with up to 30% of clients dropout and model sizes of up to $10^6$ parameters. Our approaches demonstrate markedly high efficiency with larger models, higher dropout rates, and extensive client networks, highlighting their effectiveness in enhancing decentralized learning systems' privacy and dropout robustness.","translation":"分布式学习（DL）在机器学习中提供了一个新的范式，通过在没有中央聚合的客户端之间分布训练来提高可扩展性和效率。但是，由于 DL 采用了 peer-to-peer 模型，对抗泄露攻击和隐私泄露的挑战很大。通过消除中央瓶颈，DL 需要隐私保护的聚合方法，以保护数据免受“诚实但好奇”的客户和敌人的侵害，维持整个网络的隐私。隐私保护的 DL 面临额外的障碍，即客户端断线或不可用，进一步增加了聚合的复杂性。本文提出了三种基于秘密共享的断线鲁棒性方法，用于隐私保护的 DL。我们通过对 MNIST、Fashion-MNIST、SVHN 和 CIFAR-10 等数据集的实验来评估这些协议的效率、性能和准确性。我们与传统的秘密共享解决方案在多种场景中进行了比较，包括具有 1000 个客户端的场景。评估结果显示，我们的协议明显优于传统方法，尤其是具有 30% 客户端断线和模型规模达到 $10^6$ 个参数的场景。我们的方法在增大模型、增加断线率和广泛客户端网络的情况下表现出了显著高效率，强调了它们在增强分布式学习系统的隐私和断线鲁棒性方面的有效性。","src":"arxiv-ai","idx":8,"type":"mistral_trans","src_v1":"arxiv","words_num":219,"batch_idx":35},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-08-12T03:15:20.760051Z","updated_at":"2024-08-13T12:53:26.953086Z","inner_id":36,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":38,"updated_by":6,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":17813,"annotations":[{"id":5732,"completed_by":6,"result":[{"value":{"start":33,"end":54,"text":"因为无法在任何地方租房子，因为我有5只猫。","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"zmTFA7HSsA","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":63,"end":65,"text":"堕落","labels":["Unnatural Phrase Flow"]},"id":"8dLxrV_4Aw","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":106,"end":127,"text":"拥有了一块“我要夺走你的每一分钱”的小片地","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"Ui2zkg9qI3","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":144,"end":167,"text":"我应该能够减肥很多，因为现在我不能再买食品了。","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"pfk6IaK-iC","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-08-13T12:54:22.206858Z","updated_at":"2024-08-13T12:54:22.206900Z","draft_created_at":"2024-08-13T12:53:49.523910Z","lead_time":53.981,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"256710ba-c558-43e7-a015-0e3690602159","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":17813,"project":38,"updated_by":6,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"6795f338-task_7.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"I have 5 beautiful cats.

The problem with table food is that a bite turns into a whole piece which turns into a small bowl which turns into their regular food. Table food is not a balanced diet and where it really makes a difference is when they are young and growing and need a balanced diet to achieve their optimum health and growth, and when they are older and start to develop kidney disease, liver disease, or other problems which REQUIRE restricted protein, fat, and other things. By then, all they will eat is table food and forcing a switch back to a beneficial diet like Hills Science Diet becomes impossible after years of eating from the table.","translation":"当我们喂宠物吃餐桌上的食物时，看到它们双眼放大，尾巴摇摆，表现出兴奋和喜悦的样子，每个人都会感到开心。但餐桌食物的问题在于，一小口很容易就变成一大块，然后变成一小碗，最后变成它们的常规食物。餐桌食物不是一种均衡的饮食，而这在它们年幼、正在成长并需要均衡饮食以达到最佳健康和成长状态时，以及当它们年老开始患有肾病、肝病或其他需要限制蛋白质、脂肪等摄入的疾病时，尤其重要。到那时，它们只愿意吃餐桌食物，而强制它们转换回像希尔's科学饮食这样有益的饮食，多年的餐桌饮食习惯之后将变得不可能。","src":"quora_foods","idx":470,"type":"gpt-4-turbo_end2end","src_v1":"quora","words_num":149,"batch_idx":125},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-08-12T03:15:20.771165Z","updated_at":"2024-08-14T03:16:10.554766Z","inner_id":126,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":38,"updated_by":6,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":17903,"annotations":[{"id":5864,"completed_by":6,"result":[{"value":{"start":26,"end":59,"text":"这些药物有可能成为改变千百万美国人患有2型糖尿病和肥胖问题的良药。","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"Rj1VfQOv0B","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":113,"end":122,"text":"并不能起到任何好处","labels":["Unnatural Phrase Flow"]},"id":"h7KLEcT2S1","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":147,"end":176,"text":"使联邦医疗保险、医疗补助以及整个医疗保健系统陷入破产之中。","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"bEi7BZXNSD","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-08-14T03:17:15.149807Z","updated_at":"2024-08-14T03:17:15.149840Z","draft_created_at":"2024-08-14T03:16:26.780958Z","lead_time":62.162,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"cd5ada99-2a0d-4fc2-b81a-65d3ac675dca","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":17903,"project":38,"updated_by":6,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"6795f338-task_7.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"“The scientists at Novo Nordisk deserve great credit for developing these drugs that have the potential to be a game changer for millions of Americans struggling with type 2 diabetes and obesity.

Recent strides in Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology, particularly using motor imagery, have restored motor functions such as reaching, grasping, and walking in paralyzed individuals. However, unraveling natural language from brain signals remains a formidable challenge. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique used to record electrical activity in the brain by placing electrodes on the scalp. Previous studies of EEG-to-text decoding have achieved high accuracy on small closed vocabularies, but still fall short of high accuracy when dealing with large open vocabularies. We propose a novel method, EEG2TEXT, to improve the accuracy of open vocabulary EEG-to-text decoding. Specifically, EEG2TEXT leverages EEG pre-training to enhance the learning of semantics from EEG signals and proposes a multi-view transformer to model the EEG signal processing by different spatial regions of the brain. Experiments show that EEG2TEXT has superior performance, outperforming the state-of-the-art baseline methods by a large margin of up to 5% in absolute BLEU and ROUGE scores.

Altogether, our work bridges towards next-generation RF sensors that use quantum technology to surpass previous physical limits, paired with latency-optimized AI\/ML software that is suitable for real-time deployment.","translation":"近期的研究显示了将深度学习运用于增强射频（RF）信号软件处理的潜力。与此同时，基于Rydberg原子的量子射频传感器的硬件发展正在突破长期以来限制频率范围、分辨率和灵敏度的壁垒。在本文中，我们描述了我们对RF信号分类的量子就绪机器学习方法的实施。我们的主要目标是低延迟：尽管深度学习提供了更强大的计算模式，但传统上也伴有延迟开销，阻碍了更广泛的应用。我们的工作涵盖了三个方面：（1）基于连续小波变换（CWT）的循环神经网络（RNN）架构，实现对RF信号的灵活在线分类，并减少采样时间。（2）针对GPU和CPU的低延迟推断技术，在推断时间上取得超过100倍的缩减，实现了亚毫秒推断的实时操作。（3）通过将我们的模型应用于基于物理的Rydberg原子QRF传感器模拟，验证了量子就绪性。总体而言，我们的工作为利用量子技术超越先前物理限制的下一代射频传感器搭建了桥梁，并配以适用于实时部署的延迟优化人工智能\/机器学习软件。","src":"arxiv-ai","idx":162,"type":"gpt-3.5-turbo_ctx_pivot","src_v1":"arxiv","words_num":210,"batch_idx":179},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-08-12T03:15:20.777607Z","updated_at":"2024-08-14T10:29:09.083861Z","inner_id":180,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":38,"updated_by":6,"comment_authors":[]}]
