The object kinematics are obtained via either implicit or explicit approaches, enabling comprehensive spatiotemporal object reasoning, and integrated through various transformer mechanisms, facilitating effective object-centric dynamics modeling. Our model demonstrates superior performance when handling objects and backgrounds in complex scenes characterized by a wide range of object attributes and dynamic movements. Moreover, our model demonstrates generalization capabilities across diverse synthetic environments, highlighting its potential for broad applicability in vision-related tasks.","translation":"人类感知涉及将复杂的多对象场景分辨成时间静态对象外观（即大小、形状、颜色）和时间变化的对象运动（即位置、速度、加速度）。这种无意识理解环境的天生能力是动态建模成功的动机所在。以对象为中心的表征已经成为动态预测的一种有前景的工具，但它们主要关注对象的外观，经常忽视其他重要属性。在本文中，我们提出对象中心运动学（OCK），这是一个利用对象为中心的表征进行动态预测的框架。我们的模型利用一个名为对象运动学的新颖组件，其中包括对象位置、速度和加速度的低级结构状态。对象运动学可通过隐式或显式方法获得，实现全面的时空对象推理，并通过各种变压器机制集成，促进有效的对象为中心的动态建模。我们的模型在处理具有广泛对象属性和动态运动特征的复杂场景中表现出优越的性能。此外，我们的模型在各种合成环境中展现了泛化能力，突显了在视觉相关任务中广泛适用性的潜力。","src":"arxiv-ai","idx":190,"type":"gpt-3.5-turbo_trans","src_v1":"arxiv","words_num":204},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-07-11T14:40:46.159117Z","updated_at":"2024-07-15T03:24:29.486329Z","inner_id":90,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":9,"updated_by":6,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":14033,"annotations":[{"id":1987,"completed_by":6,"result":[{"value":{"start":7,"end":11,"text":"被描述为","labels":["Unnatural Phrase Flow"]},"id":"wOhppDkmyx","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":23,"end":45,"text":"因为他织起了受害者和暴行施行者的第一人称叙述","labels":["Unnatural Phrase Flow"]},"id":"EkJF995i21","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":162,"end":178,"text":"看看在待遇上承诺的变化是否发生了","labels":["Unnatural Phrase Flow"]},"id":"SJAd1T498g","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":179,"end":208,"text":"在一份给英国外交部长的报告中，日期为1911年3月17日，","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"gzhCcx4885","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":262,"end":300,"text":"。...整个家庭...被监禁，父母和孩子，很多情况下报道称，父母就这样死去，","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"3fmb2mPYok","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-07-15T06:43:48.636896Z","updated_at":"2024-07-15T06:43:48.636927Z","draft_created_at":"2024-07-15T06:41:22.999575Z","lead_time":112.063,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"a9998e68-256b-4395-975b-e54032839c59","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":14033,"project":9,"updated_by":6,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"3388f99b-task_0.json","drafts":[{"id":1288,"user":"xxx","created_username":"xxx, 6","created_ago":"19 hours, 13 minutes","result":[{"value":{"start":7,"end":11,"text":"被描述为","labels":["Unnatural Phrase Flow"]},"id":"1TMTbSoG8O","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"lead_time":8.421,"was_postponed":false,"import_id":null,"created_at":"2024-07-15T06:44:01.755586Z","updated_at":"2024-07-15T06:44:01.755618Z","task":14033,"annotation":null}],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"Casement's report has been described as a \"brilliant piece of journalism\", as he wove together first-person accounts by both \"victims and perpetrators of atrocities ...

IntraMix efficiently tackles both challenges faced by graphs and challenges the prior notion of the limited effectiveness of Mixup in node classification. IntraMix serves as a universal framework that can be readily applied to all GNNs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of IntraMix across various GNNs and datasets.","translation":"图神经网络（GNNs）在图上表现出色，其核心思想是聚合邻域信息并从标签学习。然而，大多数图数据集中普遍面临的挑战有两个：高质量标签不足和邻域缺失，这导致了GNNs的性能弱化。现有的数据增强方法旨在解决这两个问题，但往往只解决其中一个。它们可能需要大量训练生成器，依赖过于简单的策略，或者需要大量的先验知识，从而导致次优的泛化能力。为了同时解决这两个挑战，我们提出了一种优雅的方法，称为IntraMix。IntraMix创新地在同一类别的低质量标签数据之间使用Mixup，以最小的成本生成高质量标签数据。此外，它通过将生成的数据与同一类别中高置信度的数据相连接，从而为生成的数据建立邻域，进一步丰富了图的邻域。IntraMix有效地解决了图面临的这两个挑战，并挑战了Mixup在节点分类中有效性有限的先前观念。IntraMix可作为一个通用框架，可以方便地应用于所有GNNs。广泛的实验表明，IntraMix在各种GNNs和数据集上的有效性。","src":"arxiv-ai","idx":4,"type":"gpt-4-turbo_trans","src_v1":"arxiv","words_num":210},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-07-11T14:40:46.164677Z","updated_at":"2024-07-15T10:28:14.592635Z","inner_id":135,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":9,"updated_by":6,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":14078,"annotations":[{"id":2094,"completed_by":6,"result":[{"value":{"start":18,"end":25,"text":"��opoly","labels":["Non-output"]},"id":"s28eWGeWoc","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":66,"end":84,"text":"被 Tutankhamun 宾至如归","labels":["Unnatural Phrase Flow"]},"id":"NYzh5yEIXn","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":109,"end":123,"text":"一直被人们作为晚上的娱乐之用","labels":["Unnatural Phrase Flow"]},"id":"OfsUofxsDv","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-07-15T10:29:02.963317Z","updated_at":"2024-07-15T10:29:02.963347Z","draft_created_at":"2024-07-15T10:28:32.132000Z","lead_time":41.736999999999995,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"0db03351-bcd7-47d0-9e0a-023dc08e151f","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":14078,"project":9,"updated_by":6,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"3388f99b-task_0.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"Equipment varies with the game.
