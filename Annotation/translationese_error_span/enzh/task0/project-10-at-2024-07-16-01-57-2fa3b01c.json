IntraMix efficiently tackles both challenges faced by graphs and challenges the prior notion of the limited effectiveness of Mixup in node classification. IntraMix serves as a universal framework that can be readily applied to all GNNs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of IntraMix across various GNNs and datasets.","translation":"图神经网络（GNNs）在图上表现出色，其核心思想是聚合邻域信息并从标签学习。然而，大多数图数据集中普遍面临的挑战有两个：高质量标签不足和邻域缺失，这导致了GNNs的性能弱化。现有的数据增强方法旨在解决这两个问题，但往往只解决其中一个。它们可能需要大量训练生成器，依赖过于简单的策略，或者需要大量的先验知识，从而导致次优的泛化能力。为了同时解决这两个挑战，我们提出了一种优雅的方法，称为IntraMix。IntraMix创新地在同一类别的低质量标签数据之间使用Mixup，以最小的成本生成高质量标签数据。此外，它通过将生成的数据与同一类别中高置信度的数据相连接，从而为生成的数据建立邻域，进一步丰富了图的邻域。IntraMix有效地解决了图面临的这两个挑战，并挑战了Mixup在节点分类中有效性有限的先前观念。IntraMix可作为一个通用框架，可以方便地应用于所有GNNs。广泛的实验表明，IntraMix在各种GNNs和数据集上的有效性。","src":"arxiv-ai","idx":4,"type":"gpt-4-turbo_trans","src_v1":"arxiv","words_num":210},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-07-11T14:42:14.936704Z","updated_at":"2024-07-15T02:38:37.801847Z","inner_id":135,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":10,"updated_by":11,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":14258,"annotations":[{"id":1935,"completed_by":11,"result":[{"value":{"start":41,"end":84,"text":"古代最早记录的棋盘游戏之一就是埃及的 Senet，被 Tutankhamun 宾至如归","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"FBHyN25tWg","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":166,"end":174,"text":"引起非玩家的参与","labels":["Unnatural Phrase Flow"]},"id":"POqpbI85Jk","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":229,"end":233,"text":"包括例如","labels":["Unnatural Phrase Flow"]},"id":"zZwBJT9hn3","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":271,"end":273,"text":"适应","labels":["Unnatural Phrase Flow"]},"id":"5_73qhKCg7","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-07-15T02:40:04.414968Z","updated_at":"2024-07-15T02:40:04.415005Z","draft_created_at":"2024-07-15T02:39:16.482012Z","lead_time":85.243,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"539ad16b-0099-4a57-937e-916ca825d91b","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":14258,"project":10,"updated_by":11,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"0e60168b-task_0.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"Equipment varies with the game.
