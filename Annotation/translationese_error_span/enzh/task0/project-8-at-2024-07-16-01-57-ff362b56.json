Traditional alignment strategies rely heavily on human intervention, such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), or on the self-alignment capacities of LLMs, which usually require a strong LLM's emergent ability to improve its original bad answer. To address these challenges, we propose a novel self-alignment method that utilizes a Chain of Thought (CoT) approach, termed AlignCoT.

Whole families ... were imprisonedfathers, mothers, and children, and many cases were reported of parents dying thus, either from starvation or from wounds caused by flogging, while their offspring were attached alongside them to watch in misery themselves the dying agonies of their parents.","translation":"Casement的报告被称为“出色的新闻报道”，因为他将首人经历组合在一起，包括“罪行的受害者和罪犯”。在官方文件中，远方的殖民主题人从未被授予过这种个人声音。当 Casement 向英国政府提交了他的报告时，一些富有的 PAC 会议室成员感到震惊。Arana 和秘鲁政府承诺改变。1911年，英国政府要求 Casement 返回伊奎托斯和普图马约，查看是否实现了承诺的改变。 Casement 于1911年3月17日向英国外交大臣提交了一份报告，在该报告中，他描述了印度人的继续使用刑具来惩罚印度人：","src":"wiki","idx":744,"type":"mistral_trans","src_v1":"wiki","words_num":204},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-07-11T14:38:31.985781Z","updated_at":"2024-07-15T08:32:33.943845Z","inner_id":99,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":8,"updated_by":8,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":13862,"annotations":[{"id":2026,"completed_by":8,"result":[],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-07-15T08:33:25.730899Z","updated_at":"2024-07-15T08:33:25.730934Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":49.846,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"7cae6554-ced0-41ee-9c25-e115b50ed0cf","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":13862,"project":8,"updated_by":8,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"1d502771-task_0.json","drafts":[{"id":1328,"user":"xxx","created_username":"xxx, 8","created_ago":"17 hours, 23 minutes","result":[{"value":{"start":65,"end":80,"text":"我一直都很敏感地感受到了这一点","labels":["Unnatural Phrase Flow"]},"id":"xMEiZlf0Hv","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"lead_time":18.067,"was_postponed":false,"import_id":null,"created_at":"2024-07-15T08:33:46.192210Z","updated_at":"2024-07-15T08:33:46.192241Z","task":13862,"annotation":null}],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"These JLB earbuds felt most similar to the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds.

However, the prevailing challenges in most graph datasets are twofold of Insufficient High-Quality Labels and Lack of Neighborhoods, resulting in weak GNNs. Existing data augmentation methods designed to address these two issues often tackle only one. They may either require extensive training of generators, rely on overly simplistic strategies, or demand substantial prior knowledge, leading to suboptimal generalization abilities. To simultaneously address both of these two challenges, we propose an elegant method called IntraMix. IntraMix innovatively employs Mixup among low-quality labeled data of the same class, generating high-quality labeled data at minimal cost. Additionally, it establishes neighborhoods for the generated data by connecting them with data from the same class with high confidence, thereby enriching the neighborhoods of graphs. IntraMix efficiently tackles both challenges faced by graphs and challenges the prior notion of the limited effectiveness of Mixup in node classification. IntraMix serves as a universal framework that can be readily applied to all GNNs.

IntraMix efficiently tackles both challenges faced by graphs and challenges the prior notion of the limited effectiveness of Mixup in node classification. IntraMix serves as a universal framework that can be readily applied to all GNNs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of IntraMix across various GNNs and datasets.","translation":"图神经网络（GNNs）在图上表现出色，其核心思想是聚合邻域信息并从标签学习。然而，大多数图数据集中普遍面临的挑战有两个：高质量标签不足和邻域缺失，这导致了GNNs的性能弱化。现有的数据增强方法旨在解决这两个问题，但往往只解决其中一个。它们可能需要大量训练生成器，依赖过于简单的策略，或者需要大量的先验知识，从而导致次优的泛化能力。为了同时解决这两个挑战，我们提出了一种优雅的方法，称为IntraMix。IntraMix创新地在同一类别的低质量标签数据之间使用Mixup，以最小的成本生成高质量标签数据。此外，它通过将生成的数据与同一类别中高置信度的数据相连接，从而为生成的数据建立邻域，进一步丰富了图的邻域。IntraMix有效地解决了图面临的这两个挑战，并挑战了Mixup在节点分类中有效性有限的先前观念。IntraMix可作为一个通用框架，可以方便地应用于所有GNNs。广泛的实验表明，IntraMix在各种GNNs和数据集上的有效性。","src":"arxiv-ai","idx":4,"type":"gpt-4-turbo_trans","src_v1":"arxiv","words_num":210},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-07-11T14:38:31.990913Z","updated_at":"2024-07-15T10:47:15.688555Z","inner_id":135,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":8,"updated_by":8,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":13898,"annotations":[{"id":2131,"completed_by":8,"result":[{"value":{"start":18,"end":25,"text":"��opoly","labels":["Non-output"]},"id":"nqcFi1KH3v","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":38,"end":40,"text":"标记","labels":["Mistranslations"]},"id":"mVOcM1QSyR","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":67,"end":80,"text":" Tutankhamun ","labels":["Non-output"]},"id":"q4M91kPKDJ","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":80,"end":84,"text":"宾至如归","labels":["Mistranslations"]},"id":"VX7uA3xdRV","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":153,"end":160,"text":"参与多位陌生人","labels":["Unnatural Phrase Flow"]},"id":"tDNg8F0pvD","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-07-15T10:47:55.306512Z","updated_at":"2024-07-15T10:48:52.447165Z","draft_created_at":"2024-07-15T10:47:52.417543Z","lead_time":52.641,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"9244d56e-a352-4983-9a1a-0e42690d1f18","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":13898,"project":8,"updated_by":8,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"1d502771-task_0.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"Equipment varies with the game.
