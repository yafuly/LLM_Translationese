However, their large model sizes and high computational and memory demands hinder deployment, especially on resource-constrained devices. This underscores the necessity of algorithm-hardware co-design specific to ViTs, aiming to optimize their performance by tailoring both the algorithmic structure and the underlying hardware accelerator to each other's strengths. Model quantization, by converting high-precision numbers to lower-precision, reduces the computational demands and memory needs of ViTs, allowing the creation of hardware specifically optimized for these quantized algorithms, boosting efficiency. This article provides a comprehensive survey of ViTs quantization and its hardware acceleration. We first delve into the unique architectural attributes of ViTs and their runtime characteristics. Subsequently, we examine the fundamental principles of model quantization, followed by a comparative analysis of the state-of-the-art quantization techniques for ViTs.

For OTA, we demonstrate the inability of common defense strategies to mitigate the attack, highlighting the critical need for new defensive mechanisms against targeted attacks within FL for autonomous driving.","translation":"联邦学习（FL）是一种分散式学习方法，它使得各方可以在保护数据隐私的前提下，共同训练模型。在自动驾驶领域中，该方法可以降低数据存储成本、减少带宽需求，并且加速学习过程。然而，FL也容易受到污染攻击的影响。本文介绍了两种针对自动驾驶任务的联邦学习污染攻击：FLStealth和Off-Track Attack（OTA）。前者是一种无针对性攻击，旨在通过向服务器提供模型更新，使其全局性表现恶化，同时伪装成无害的更新；后者则是针对性攻击，旨在通过触发特定信号使服务器的全局模型行为发生变化。我们通过对汽车运动轨迹预测任务进行全面的实验，证明了这两种攻击的有效性。特别地，我们证明了其中的一种无针对性攻击FLStealth在服务器采取的防御策略面前能够轻松突破，这表明了对针对性攻击的防御必须重新设计。","src":"arxiv-ai","idx":193,"type":"alma_13B_trans","src_v1":"arxiv","words_num":215,"batch_idx":107},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-07-26T05:14:38.686062Z","updated_at":"2024-07-29T12:22:17.559349Z","inner_id":108,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":24,"updated_by":6,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":16211,"annotations":[{"id":4060,"completed_by":6,"result":[{"value":{"start":4,"end":18,"text":"男性人类的反射能力很高度进化","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"lg0j9d39Qd","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":122,"end":145,"text":"能够在女性中大多数人的行为都会造成危险的情况下","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"pFHtUDve99","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-07-29T12:22:52.023216Z","updated_at":"2024-07-29T12:22:52.023249Z","draft_created_at":"2024-07-29T12:22:35.088499Z","lead_time":26.336,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"8b56b5c2-69ee-4c11-9095-d1406e3f2c71","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":16211,"project":24,"updated_by":6,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"d9bfcf66-task_4.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"16.

Polotsk was a key fortress on the way to Kiev, and capturing Polotsk and Smolensk facilitated the taking of Kiev in 978, where he slew Yaropolk by treachery and was proclaimed knyaz of all Kievan Rus'.","translation":"斯维亚托斯拉夫迁都至佩列亚斯拉维茨，970年指定弗拉基米尔为诺夫哥罗德的统治者，但将基辅交给了他的嫡子亚罗波尔克。斯维亚托斯拉夫于972年死于佩切涅格人之手后，977年亚罗波尔克与其弟奥列格（德列缅人的统治者）之间爆发了兄弟间的战争；弗拉基米尔逃往国外，并集结了一支瓦良格军团帮助他废黜亚罗波尔克。次年归来时，他向亚罗波尔克进军。在前往基辅的途中，他派遣使者到罗格沃洛德（北欧：拉格纳尔德），波洛茨克亲王，求婚其女罗涅达（北欧：拉戈尼德）。这位高贵的公主拒绝与一个奴隶之子订婚（她已与亚罗波尔克订婚），因此弗拉基米尔攻打波洛茨克，强行夺走拉戈尼德，并将其父母杀死。波洛茨克是通往基辅的关键要塞，攻占波洛茨克和斯摩棱斯克有助于在978年夺取基辅，他在那里通过诡计杀死了亚罗波尔克，并被宣布为基辅罗斯的所有地区的克尼亚兹（王子）。","src":"wiki","idx":708,"type":"gpt-4-turbo_trans","src_v1":"wiki","words_num":199,"batch_idx":170},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-07-26T05:14:38.692877Z","updated_at":"2024-07-30T04:39:20.263768Z","inner_id":171,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":24,"updated_by":6,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":16274,"annotations":[{"id":4240,"completed_by":6,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":26,"text":"这条短裤是一种不错的快速选择，如果你需要偶尔穿一对。","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"vi1FR9arZG","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":52,"end":73,"text":"而且腿部的剪头比我所希望的稍微更加限制性。","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"CqEJ8Ht9ba","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":129,"end":144,"text":"如果你需要一款紧急情况下的泳衣","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"fGdeoh_Tym","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":153,"end":164,"text":"能够持续季节之后的使用","labels":["Unnatural Phrase Flow"]},"id":"YPpg1VEnvP","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-07-30T03:08:32.548528Z","updated_at":"2024-07-30T03:08:32.548561Z","draft_created_at":"2024-07-30T03:07:55.545416Z","lead_time":51.83,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"fa9f65e6-164c-4e01-9b98-b65ed0a41697","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":16274,"project":24,"updated_by":6,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"d9bfcf66-task_4.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"These shorts are a good, quick option if you need a pair to throw on every once in a while.

Overall, these are a good pair of shorts if you need a swimsuit in a pinch, just don't expect them to last season after season. — Kai Burkhardt, outdoor, sustainability and pets editor","translation":"这条短裤是个不错的快速选择，当你偶尔需要随便穿一条的时候。我喜欢它的口袋和看上去挺不错，但是要注意，这款面料并不具备弹性，而且剪裁在大腿处有些过紧。内部网布虽然没有我穿过的一些泳裤那么不舒服，但在这上面坐上几个小时划独木舟可能就会有些不便。总的来说，如果需要临时的游泳裤的话，这款短裤挺不错的选择，不过不要期望它们可以季季都保持在好状态。— Kai Burkhardt，户外、可持续性和宠物编辑","src":"cnn-news","idx":397,"type":"gpt-3.5-turbo_ctx_pivot","src_v1":"cnn","words_num":126,"batch_idx":178},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-07-26T05:14:38.697010Z","updated_at":"2024-07-30T03:13:21.515616Z","inner_id":179,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":24,"updated_by":6,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":16282,"annotations":[{"id":4249,"completed_by":6,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":33,"text":"这些短裤是一个不错的快捷选择，如果你偶尔需要一条可以随便穿的短裤。","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"2oCt6bbOth","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-07-30T03:13:45.007825Z","updated_at":"2024-07-30T03:13:45.007864Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":22.258,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"51e44398-fcb2-4b2f-816b-326422b6e479","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":16282,"project":24,"updated_by":6,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"d9bfcf66-task_4.json","drafts":[{"id":3315,"user":"xxx","created_username":"xxx, 6","created_ago":"2 days, 6 hours","result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":33,"text":"这些短裤是一个不错的快捷选择，如果你偶尔需要一条可以随便穿的短裤。","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"2oCt6bbOth","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"lead_time":14.756,"was_postponed":false,"import_id":null,"created_at":"2024-07-30T03:13:37.483164Z","updated_at":"2024-07-30T03:13:37.483195Z","task":16282,"annotation":null}],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"These shorts are a good, quick option if you need a pair to throw on every once in a while.
