Sullivan) that they should jointly produce what are now called the \"Black Diaries\" in evidence, as this would most likely cause the court to find Casement \"guilty but insane\" and save his life. Casement refused to agree to this and was subsequently found guilty and sentenced to be hanged. Before and during the trial and appeal, the British government secretly circulated some excerpts from Casement's journals, exposing Casement as a \"sexual deviant\". These included numerous explicit accounts of sexual activity. This aroused public opinion against him and influenced those notables who might otherwise have tried to intervene. Given societal norms and the illegality of homosexuality at the time, support for Casement's reprieve declined in some quarters. The journals became known in the 1950s as the \"Black Diaries\" and are still in the British National Archives, whilst most of the other exhibits from the trial are in the Crime Museum in London.","translation":"在他的审判期间，一名律师（F.

Model quantization, by converting high-precision numbers to lower-precision, reduces the computational demands and memory needs of ViTs, allowing the creation of hardware specifically optimized for these quantized algorithms, boosting efficiency. This article provides a comprehensive survey of ViTs quantization and its hardware acceleration. We first delve into the unique architectural attributes of ViTs and their runtime characteristics. Subsequently, we examine the fundamental principles of model quantization, followed by a comparative analysis of the state-of-the-art quantization techniques for ViTs. Additionally, we explore the hardware acceleration of quantized ViTs, highlighting the importance of hardware-friendly algorithm design. In conclusion, this article will discuss ongoing challenges and future research paths.

In August of the same year, an agreement was made between Ari Jabotinsky (the son of Ze'ev Jabotinsky), the Betar representative and Hillel Kook, the Irgun representative, to coordinate the immigration (also known as Ha'apala). This agreement was also made in the \"Paris Convention\" in February 1939, at which Ze'ev Jabotinsky and David Raziel were present. Afterwards, the \"Aliyah Center\" was founded, made up of representatives of Hatzohar, Betar, and the Irgun, thereby making the Irgun a full participant in the process.","translation":"1937 年 9 月，伊尔古兹与哈扎尔和巴特尔合作，帮助一艘由 54 名巴特尔成员组成的护卫舰队顺利抵达特纳图拉海滩 (位于海法附近)。伊尔古兹负责秘密将以色列奥利姆移民送到海滩，并分散到各个犹太社区，伊尔古兹还开始参与组织奥利姆移民的工作。1938 年 9 月，一艘名为“杜拉加”的船舶抵达了巴勒斯坦的英国沿海地区，并在同一年的8月，在“巴黎会议”上，阿里·雅博提诺斯 (便是泽维·雅博提诺斯的儿子) 和希莱尔·科克代表哈扎尔、巴特尔和伊尔古兹，就组织奥利姆移民达成了协议。随后，“阿利亚赫中心” (哈扎尔、巴特尔、伊尔古兹的联盟组织) 就此诞生，伊尔古兹也正式成为奥利姆移民的参与者。","src":"wiki","idx":665,"type":"alma_7B_trans","src_v1":"wiki","words_num":204,"batch_idx":143},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-07-26T05:16:04.490661Z","updated_at":"2024-07-30T06:23:25.115220Z","inner_id":144,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":26,"updated_by":8,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":16607,"annotations":[{"id":4316,"completed_by":8,"result":[{"value":{"start":46,"end":74,"text":"传统方法为实现此时空对齐依赖外部设备提供定位和时钟信号。","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"UKhLxLNkKy","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":200,"end":240,"text":"我们系统的关键模块FreeAlign，基于每个代理检测的包围盒构建显著的物体图，","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"TeOo0wIgyl","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-07-30T06:24:06.225658Z","updated_at":"2024-07-30T06:24:42.534577Z","draft_created_at":"2024-07-30T06:24:01.244467Z","lead_time":72.753,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"63b97184-4d18-40fd-810a-b20abf601857","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":16607,"project":26,"updated_by":8,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"bbd9d96f-task_4.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"A consistent spatial-temporal coordination across multiple agents is fundamental for collaborative perception, which seeks to improve perception abilities through information exchange among agents.

To achieve this spatial-temporal alignment, traditional methods depend on external devices to provide localization and clock signals. However, hardware-generated signals could be vulnerable to noise and potentially malicious attack, jeopardizing the precision of spatial-temporal alignment. Rather than relying on external hardwares, this work proposes a novel approach: aligning by recognizing the inherent geometric patterns within the perceptual data of various agents. Following this spirit, we propose a robust collaborative perception system that operates independently of external localization and clock devices.

Polotsk was a key fortress on the way to Kiev, and capturing Polotsk and Smolensk facilitated the taking of Kiev in 978, where he slew Yaropolk by treachery and was proclaimed knyaz of all Kievan Rus'.","translation":"斯维亚托斯拉夫迁都至佩列亚斯拉维茨，970年指定弗拉基米尔为诺夫哥罗德的统治者，但将基辅交给了他的嫡子亚罗波尔克。斯维亚托斯拉夫于972年死于佩切涅格人之手后，977年亚罗波尔克与其弟奥列格（德列缅人的统治者）之间爆发了兄弟间的战争；弗拉基米尔逃往国外，并集结了一支瓦良格军团帮助他废黜亚罗波尔克。次年归来时，他向亚罗波尔克进军。在前往基辅的途中，他派遣使者到罗格沃洛德（北欧：拉格纳尔德），波洛茨克亲王，求婚其女罗涅达（北欧：拉戈尼德）。这位高贵的公主拒绝与一个奴隶之子订婚（她已与亚罗波尔克订婚），因此弗拉基米尔攻打波洛茨克，强行夺走拉戈尼德，并将其父母杀死。波洛茨克是通往基辅的关键要塞，攻占波洛茨克和斯摩棱斯克有助于在978年夺取基辅，他在那里通过诡计杀死了亚罗波尔克，并被宣布为基辅罗斯的所有地区的克尼亚兹（王子）。","src":"wiki","idx":708,"type":"gpt-4-turbo_trans","src_v1":"wiki","words_num":199,"batch_idx":170},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-07-26T05:16:04.492074Z","updated_at":"2024-07-30T07:31:26.226370Z","inner_id":171,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":26,"updated_by":8,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":16634,"annotations":[{"id":4177,"completed_by":8,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":25,"text":"这条短裤是一种不错的快速选择，如果你需要偶尔穿一对","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"OUHOo24z4M","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":92,"end":96,"text":"那么舒服","labels":["Mistranslations"]},"id":"wzYYrJkaXT","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":97,"end":113,"text":"但是我不想在这些里面坐上几个小时","labels":["Mistranslations"]},"id":"7zxtPJf_y3","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":119,"end":145,"text":"这是一对不错的短裤，如果你需要一款紧急情况下的泳衣，","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"WY3tPH4RV4","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":145,"end":164,"text":"但是请不要期望它能够持续季节之后的使用","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"hzjHILHOHl","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-07-29T18:04:53.553254Z","updated_at":"2024-07-29T18:04:53.553289Z","draft_created_at":"2024-07-29T18:03:46.818400Z","lead_time":79.094,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"ee159021-59a5-42f4-b54e-98ed7bda3ca6","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":16634,"project":26,"updated_by":8,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"bbd9d96f-task_4.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"These shorts are a good, quick option if you need a pair to throw on every once in a while.
