They do still feature JBL’s excellent Ambient Aware mode, which is more important when it comes to staying safe. The drawback for me was the size and weight of the Endurance Peak 3 earbuds. The speaker compartment is bulkier than any other headphone we tested, both in size and weight. A bendable ear hook helps keep them secure, but we didn’t love the sensation of wearing these for a two-hour run.","translation":"这款耳机的名字背后寓意着它们可以“跑完全程”，而且耳塞上的电池可以为您提供最长达10个小时的使用时间，而且另外还有40个小时的储备电量。这是因为它们没有配备了Active Noise Cancellation功能，而在跑步时，这并不是必需的。它们仍然拥有JBL的“环境感知”模式，这种模式在保证安全方面更为重要。不过，我个人认为这款耳机的大小和重量是其缺点之一。耳塞部分的尺寸和重量都比其他测试产品更大，而且柔软的耳夹可以让它们在耳朵上保持牢固。不过，我在使用它们进行两小时的跑步时并不喜欢戴在耳朵上的感觉。","src":"cnn-news","idx":269,"type":"alma_13B_trans","src_v1":"cnn","words_num":137,"batch_idx":35},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-08-15T02:30:11.717893Z","updated_at":"2024-08-20T13:01:25.740756Z","inner_id":36,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":41,"updated_by":6,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":18353,"annotations":[{"id":6328,"completed_by":6,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":14,"text":"鸟类的蛋一般都是在巢内产下。","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"we2ewXxHmy","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":251,"end":291,"text":"由于巢内的任何物质都会使巢更加明显，因此它们的幼鸟往往是在没有巢的地方直接产下。","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"_IEf4bqLYN","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":305,"end":312,"text":"孵化同步的蛋，","labels":["Unnatural Phrase Flow"]},"id":"OscGRyqawP","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":70,"end":83,"text":"巢底可能会有较少或没有垫料","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"zJOoWv1CYT","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-08-18T13:36:55.856789Z","updated_at":"2024-08-20T13:01:45.134688Z","draft_created_at":"2024-08-18T13:36:01.636029Z","lead_time":80.792,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"42974bb7-63ec-4329-9274-05342e5881fa","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":18353,"project":41,"updated_by":6,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"10113144-task_8.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"Bird eggs are usually laid in a nest.

Madison believed that economic pressure could force the British to end their seizure of American shipped goods, and he and Jefferson convinced Congress to pass the Embargo Act of 1807, which banned all exports to foreign nations. The embargo proved ineffective, unpopular, and difficult to enforce, especially in New England. In March 1809, Congress replaced the embargo with the Non-Intercourse Act, which allowed trade with nations other than Britain and France.","translation":"Jefferson 初期，他能够与法国和英国保持和好的关系，但是后来于1805年开始，与英国关系逐渐恶化。英国放弃了对美国航运的宽容政策，开始抓捕向法国港口运送的美国货物。他们还强制服役美国海员，其中一些是原来从英国 navy 脱颖而出的，但是一些则从来不是英国公民。为了回应这些攻击，国会通过了 Non-importation Act，限制了许多，但并非所有英国进口。因为 \"Chesapeake–Leopard\" 事件（1807年6月的美英海军冲突），美国和英国之间的紧张情势加剧了，同时法国也开始攻击美国航运。Madison 认为经济压力可以迫使英国停止抓捕美国货物，他和 Jefferson 将 Embargo Act of 1807 提交给了国会，该法规禁止向外国出口所有商品。但是禁令无效，不受欢迎，并且尤其难以执行，尤其是在新英兰。在1809年3月，国会取代了禁令，通过了 Non-Intercourse Act，允许与除了英国和法国之外的国家进行贸易。","src":"wiki","idx":794,"type":"mistral_trans","src_v1":"wiki","words_num":211,"batch_idx":89},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-08-15T02:30:11.724820Z","updated_at":"2024-08-19T05:45:11.996156Z","inner_id":90,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":41,"updated_by":6,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":18407,"annotations":[{"id":6412,"completed_by":6,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":44,"text":"当前对演员-评论家（AC）算法的前沿理论分析在解冑AC实现的实际方面方面存在较大的滞后。","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"w2QAhypCJk","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":44,"end":73,"text":"弥合这一关键差距，使分析与AC的实际实现相符合，势在必行。","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"nH6Dr284kS","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-08-19T05:46:27.733661Z","updated_at":"2024-08-19T05:46:27.733695Z","draft_created_at":"2024-08-19T05:46:17.152994Z","lead_time":74.538,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"5d4fb78d-b6e8-4738-92eb-41f8f1418393","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":18407,"project":41,"updated_by":6,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"10113144-task_8.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"The current state-of-the-art theoretical analysis of Actor-Critic (AC) algorithms significantly lags in addressing the practical aspects of AC implementations.

Following World War II, during a period of social repression when governments actively persecuted homosexuals, women developed networks to socialize with and educate each other. Gaining greater economic and social freedom allowed them to determine how they could form relationships and families. With second-wave feminism and the growth of scholarship in women's history and sexuality in the late 20th century, the definition of \"lesbian\" broadened, leading to debate about the term's use. While research by Lisa M. Diamond identified sexual desire as the core component for defining lesbians, some women who engage in same-sex sexual activity may reject not only identifying as lesbians but as bisexual as well. Other women's self-identification as lesbian may not align with their sexual orientation or sexual behavior.
