A bendable ear hook helps keep them secure, but we didn’t love the sensation of wearing these for a two-hour run.","translation":"这款耳机的名字背后寓意着它们可以“跑完全程”，而且耳塞上的电池可以为您提供最长达10个小时的使用时间，而且另外还有40个小时的储备电量。这是因为它们没有配备了Active Noise Cancellation功能，而在跑步时，这并不是必需的。它们仍然拥有JBL的“环境感知”模式，这种模式在保证安全方面更为重要。不过，我个人认为这款耳机的大小和重量是其缺点之一。耳塞部分的尺寸和重量都比其他测试产品更大，而且柔软的耳夹可以让它们在耳朵上保持牢固。不过，我在使用它们进行两小时的跑步时并不喜欢戴在耳朵上的感觉。","src":"cnn-news","idx":269,"type":"alma_13B_trans","src_v1":"cnn","words_num":137,"batch_idx":35},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-08-15T02:31:20.495281Z","updated_at":"2024-08-15T14:27:08.952928Z","inner_id":36,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":43,"updated_by":14,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":18713,"annotations":[{"id":6129,"completed_by":14,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":13,"text":"鸟类的蛋一般都是在巢内产下","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"D74gNtGG4y","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":27,"end":45,"text":"形状可能是盘状、圆顶状、盘状或是堆状","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"umig3bYmr5","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":70,"end":83,"text":"巢底可能会有较少或没有垫料","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"9XvRmOeZ6-","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":185,"end":187,"text":"物种","labels":["Unnatural Phrase Flow"]},"id":"GsZRvwbwlu","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":237,"end":250,"text":"比如岸上栖息的地面筑巢物种","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"QwsFCS7ypu","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":251,"end":268,"text":"由于巢内的任何物质都会使巢更加明显","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"9_QTbJxFVI","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":269,"end":290,"text":"因此它们的幼鸟往往是在没有巢的地方直接产下","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"35ubYrzCOP","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":303,"end":311,"text":"一批孵化同步的蛋","labels":["Unnatural Phrase Flow"]},"id":"iVps6USlnI","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":331,"end":338,"text":"尚未成熟的雏鸟","labels":["Unnatural Phrase Flow"]},"id":"gUDBsCZAmm","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":345,"end":365,"text":"雏鸟尚未离巢”（nidifugous）。","labels":["Unnatural Phrase Flow"]},"id":"LTPptbEjbk","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":183,"end":211,"text":"有些物种会挑选具有杀虫作用的植物毒素来增强幼鸟的生存能力","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"8pXA0hM4zn","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-08-16T01:59:23.400312Z","updated_at":"2024-08-16T02:06:03.173968Z","draft_created_at":"2024-08-16T01:56:32.185997Z","lead_time":453.142,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"55f68061-8419-4364-8716-fddfa32aca9c","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":18713,"project":43,"updated_by":14,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"54449d34-task_8.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"Bird eggs are usually laid in a nest.

Most birds build nests in sheltered, hidden areas to avoid predation, but large or colonial birds—which are more capable of defence—may build more open nests.

Through comprehensive evaluation, our approach demonstrates effectiveness in balancing fairness and efficacy across various real-world applications, FL setups, and scenarios involving single and multiple bias-inducing factors, representing a significant advancement in human-centered FL.","translation":"联邦学习（FL）支持多方在保护数据隐私的同时共同训练模型，非常适合去中心化的、以人为本的人工智能应用。然而，确保这些系统公平性的研究仍然存在显著空白。现有的FL公平性策略需要识别出造成偏见的敏感属性，这与FL的隐私保护原则相冲突。此外，在以人为本的数据集中，敏感属性往往是隐蔽的。为应对这些挑战，我们提出了一种新颖的偏见减轻方法，其灵感来自于机器学习中的“无人口统计公平性”。该方法通过在训练过程中最小化赫西矩阵的最大特征值，无需识别敏感属性即可实现公平性，确保所有FL参与者的损失景观公平一致。特别地，我们引入了一种新型FL聚合方案，根据模型的错误率和损失景观曲率特性来促进模型的参与，从而在整个FL系统中推动公平性。本项工作是首次在以人为本的FL中实现“无人口统计公平性”。通过全面的评估，我们的方法在多种实际应用、FL配置及涉及单个或多个偏见诱因的场景中证明了其在平衡公平性和效能方面的有效性，标志着以人为本的FL领域的重大进展。","src":"arxiv-ai","idx":120,"type":"gpt-4-turbo_ctx_pivot","src_v1":"arxiv","words_num":206,"batch_idx":71},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-08-15T02:31:20.502833Z","updated_at":"2024-08-19T02:11:24.575367Z","inner_id":72,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":43,"updated_by":14,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":18749,"annotations":[{"id":6370,"completed_by":14,"result":[{"value":{"start":19,"end":27,"text":"，使用的语义表示","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"tWyfGhdH5Q","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":35,"end":54,"text":"通常是由语言专家经过深思熟虑而创造的。","labels":["Mistranslations"]},"id":"DTS6iTxicf","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":78,"end":98,"text":"被转化为基于序列生成的简单、顺序性的任务","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"9sja6cOGLj","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":201,"end":216,"text":"一般会降低性能，而不会提高性能","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"8oqHcX1hBD","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":252,"end":272,"text":"我们发现无法预测哪些输入是语义表示有利的","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"2KddJvBG3e","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":303,"end":335,"text":"我们建议以后的工作重点是如何使用语义表示来提高大型语言模型的性能","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"v464UFbDmr","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-08-19T02:17:01.788913Z","updated_at":"2024-08-19T02:46:04.247256Z","draft_created_at":"2024-08-19T02:12:35.554944Z","lead_time":346.88800000000003,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"dee4e74a-562e-454d-b72d-490b6e41ce65","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":18749,"project":43,"updated_by":14,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"54449d34-task_8.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"Traditionally, natural language processing (NLP) models often use a rich set of features created by linguistic expertise, such as semantic representations.

In March 1809, Congress replaced the embargo with the Non-Intercourse Act, which allowed trade with nations other than Britain and France.","translation":"Jefferson 初期，他能够与法国和英国保持和好的关系，但是后来于1805年开始，与英国关系逐渐恶化。英国放弃了对美国航运的宽容政策，开始抓捕向法国港口运送的美国货物。他们还强制服役美国海员，其中一些是原来从英国 navy 脱颖而出的，但是一些则从来不是英国公民。为了回应这些攻击，国会通过了 Non-importation Act，限制了许多，但并非所有英国进口。因为 \"Chesapeake–Leopard\" 事件（1807年6月的美英海军冲突），美国和英国之间的紧张情势加剧了，同时法国也开始攻击美国航运。Madison 认为经济压力可以迫使英国停止抓捕美国货物，他和 Jefferson 将 Embargo Act of 1807 提交给了国会，该法规禁止向外国出口所有商品。但是禁令无效，不受欢迎，并且尤其难以执行，尤其是在新英兰。在1809年3月，国会取代了禁令，通过了 Non-Intercourse Act，允许与除了英国和法国之外的国家进行贸易。","src":"wiki","idx":794,"type":"mistral_trans","src_v1":"wiki","words_num":211,"batch_idx":89},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-08-15T02:31:20.503889Z","updated_at":"2024-08-19T03:51:21.440478Z","inner_id":90,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":43,"updated_by":14,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":18767,"annotations":[{"id":6388,"completed_by":14,"result":[{"value":{"start":36,"end":43,"text":"存在较大的滞后","labels":["Unnatural Phrase Flow"]},"id":"sTYNjG-3vd","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":146,"end":151,"text":"实际重要性","labels":["Unnatural Phrase Flow"]},"id":"-TOkMP48k-","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":44,"end":72,"text":"弥合这一关键差距，使分析与AC的实际实现相符合，势在必行","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"NLYPWkJXXZ","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-08-19T03:59:46.342792Z","updated_at":"2024-08-19T05:58:28.629980Z","draft_created_at":"2024-08-19T03:52:38.434210Z","lead_time":540.43,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"ded4c37f-34fe-487d-bf79-2d4b4711a21f","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":18767,"project":43,"updated_by":14,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"54449d34-task_8.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"The current state-of-the-art theoretical analysis of Actor-Critic (AC) algorithms significantly lags in addressing the practical aspects of AC implementations.
