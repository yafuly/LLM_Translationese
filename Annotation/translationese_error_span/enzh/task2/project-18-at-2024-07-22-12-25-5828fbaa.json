In particular, current approaches focus on optimizing individual agent actions but often overlook the nuances of collective intelligence. Group dynamics might require that one agent (e.g., the AI system) compensate for biases and errors in another agent (e.g., the human), but this compensation should be carefully developed. We provide a theoretical framework for algorithmic compensation that synthesizes game theory and reinforcement learning principles to demonstrate the natural emergence of deceptive outcomes from the continuous learning dynamics of agents. We provide simulation results involving Markov Decision Processes (MDP) learning to interact. This work then underpins our ethical analysis of the conditions in which AI agents should adapt to biases and behaviors of other agents in dynamic and complex decision-making environments. Overall, our approach addresses the nuanced role of strategic deception of humans, challenging previous assumptions about its detrimental effects.

Through an evaluation process involving metrics such as BERTScore, ROUGE, and BLEU, we assess the performance of each model in accurately identifying and summarizing customer needs. Our findings highlight the efficacy of opensource LLMs, particularly Mistral 7B, in achieving comparable performance to larger closed models while offering affordability and customization benefits. Additionally, we underscore the importance of considering factors such as model size, resource requirements, and performance metrics when selecting the most suitable LLM for customer needs analysis tasks. Overall, this study contributes valuable insights for businesses seeking to leverage advanced NLP techniques to enhance customer experience and drive operational efficiency in the travel industry.","translation":"在自然语言处理（NLP）领域快速发展的背景下，大型语言模型（LLMs）已成为许多任务的强大工具，例如从海量文本数据中提取有价值见解。本研究旨在比较分析LLMs在提取TripAdvisor帖子中的旅行客户需求方面的表现。我们运用各种模型，包括开源和专有模型，如GPT-4和Gemini，旨在揭示它们在这一专业领域中的优势与劣势。通过评估过程，包括BERTScore、ROUGE和BLEU等指标，我们评估每个模型在准确识别和概括客户需求方面的性能。研究结果凸显了开源LLMs的有效性，特别是Mistral 7B，在价格实惠和定制化优势的基础上实现了与更大闭源模型相当的表现。此外，我们强调在选择最适合的LLM用于客户需求分析任务时，考虑模型大小、资源要求和性能指标等因素的重要性。总的来说，本研究为寻求利用先进的NLP技术来提升客户体验和提高旅行业运营效率的企业提供了宝贵见解。","src":"arxiv-ai","idx":52,"type":"gpt-3.5-turbo_ctx_pivot","src_v1":"arxiv","words_num":212,"batch_idx":126},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-07-18T10:06:55.097113Z","updated_at":"2024-07-22T08:26:52.830557Z","inner_id":127,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":18,"updated_by":11,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":15330,"annotations":[{"id":2972,"completed_by":11,"result":[{"value":{"start":112,"end":169,"text":"通过利用各种各样的模型，包括开源和专有模型，如GPT-4和Gemini，我们旨在阐明它们在这一专门领域的优势和劣势","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"rgXXEfZuKs","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":229,"end":296,"text":"我们的研究结果突出了开源LLMs的功效，尤其是Mistral 7B，在实现与更大闭源模型相媲美的表现的同时，提供了价格实惠和定制化优势","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"-x3J9TbKzt","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":355,"end":402,"text":"这项研究为寻求利用先进的NLP技术来提升客户体验并在旅行业提高运营效率的企业提供了有价值的见解","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"w6bJ3XC2ri","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-07-22T02:25:37.035476Z","updated_at":"2024-07-22T08:27:01.710876Z","draft_created_at":"2024-07-22T02:19:16.322732Z","lead_time":432.435,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"e074a813-4328-4208-bd21-3f496cea7053","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":15330,"project":18,"updated_by":11,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"bf7741d4-task_2.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"In the rapidly evolving landscape of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for many tasks, such as extracting valuable insights from vast amounts of textual data.
