Moreover, the experimental results reveal the potential of deep learning models in understanding human emotions and cognitive processes and establish a manifold visualization interpretation of cognitive products or psychological attributes from a non-Euclidean space perspective, offering new insights into enhancing the explainability of AI. This study not only advances the application of AI technology in the field of psychology but also provides a new psychological theoretical understanding the information processing of the AI.

Although reward shaping is a powerful technique for enhancing learning efficiency, it can introduce biases that affect agent performance. Furthermore, potential-based reward shaping is constrained as it does not allow for reward modifications based on actions or terminal states, potentially limiting its effectiveness in complex environments. Additionally, large language models (LLMs) can achieve zero-shot learning, but this is generally limited to simpler tasks. They also exhibit low inference speeds and occasionally produce hallucinations. To address these issues, we propose LLM-guided Q-learning that employs LLMs as heuristic to aid in learning the Q-function for reinforcement learning.

Through an evaluation process involving metrics such as BERTScore, ROUGE, and BLEU, we assess the performance of each model in accurately identifying and summarizing customer needs. Our findings highlight the efficacy of opensource LLMs, particularly Mistral 7B, in achieving comparable performance to larger closed models while offering affordability and customization benefits. Additionally, we underscore the importance of considering factors such as model size, resource requirements, and performance metrics when selecting the most suitable LLM for customer needs analysis tasks. Overall, this study contributes valuable insights for businesses seeking to leverage advanced NLP techniques to enhance customer experience and drive operational efficiency in the travel industry.","translation":"在快速变化的自然语言处理领域，大型语言模型 (LLMs)已经成为很多任务的有效工具，例如从海量的文本数据中提取有价值的洞见。本研究旨在对大型语言模型在旅游行业的需求分析领域中的表现进行比较，并通过评估一系列指标，包括BERTScore、ROUGE和BLEU，来评估各个模型的准确性和简洁性。我们的研究结果显示，在这个特定的领域中，开源模型的表现与大型闭源模型相当，且可以提供成本效益和定制化优势。此外，我们还提醒企业在选择适合旅游行业需求分析任务的语言模型时，应考虑模型大小、资源消耗量和性能指标等因素。本研究还为企业在旅游行业中利用语言处理技术提升客户体验和提高运营效率提供了有价值的参考。","src":"arxiv-ai","idx":52,"type":"alma_7B_trans","src_v1":"arxiv","words_num":212,"batch_idx":132},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-07-18T10:07:22.772645Z","updated_at":"2024-07-22T06:49:50.552665Z","inner_id":133,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":19,"updated_by":8,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":15516,"annotations":[{"id":3108,"completed_by":8,"result":[],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-07-22T06:49:59.190465Z","updated_at":"2024-07-22T06:49:59.190497Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":7.433,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"f95044d2-198d-47b4-bba2-d2e39344e66c","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":15516,"project":19,"updated_by":8,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"34a2e90d-task_2.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"In the rapidly evolving landscape of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for many tasks, such as extracting valuable insights from vast amounts of textual data.
