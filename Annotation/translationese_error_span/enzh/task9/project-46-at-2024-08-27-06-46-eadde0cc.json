These sets are made to make the giant rectangular space where your television goes a bit more dynamic, as they can display works of fine art when you’re not binge-watching TV or streaming a movie. This year’s models feature improved accuracy, thanks to the folks at Pantone who are providing color validation. On top of that, you can update The Frame’s style whenever you want, thanks to magnetic bezels that come in multiple styles, including metallic and wood tones — perfect for helping the TV fit alongside Mom’s favorite works of art.","translation":"根据格鲁梅特·赛加尔推荐的Kindle和Beats Fit Pro耳塞之外，她还提到三星的The Frame电视是她的最爱之一。这些套装旨在使您的电视放置处的巨大矩形空间更具动态感，因为它们在您不观看电视连续剧或流媒体电影时可以展示艺术作品。今年的型号具有更高的准确性，这要归功于Pantone提供的颜色验证。除此之外，您可以随时更新The Frame的风格，这要归功于可更改的磁性边框，包括金属和木材色调，非常适合帮助电视与母亲最喜欢的艺术品相得益彰。","src":"cnn-news","idx":221,"type":"gpt-3.5-turbo_trans","src_v1":"cnn","words_num":138,"batch_idx":35},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-08-20T10:29:29.844071Z","updated_at":"2024-08-26T15:47:57.746581Z","inner_id":36,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":46,"updated_by":6,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":19253,"annotations":[{"id":6781,"completed_by":6,"result":[{"value":{"start":31,"end":43,"text":"Atom在我的躯干上较窄","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"bQ9iD8ocE2","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":159,"end":181,"text":"请记住这一点，如果你是要替换一个较旧的款式。","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"niVxy-LpTW","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-08-21T15:06:50.741398Z","updated_at":"2024-08-21T15:06:50.741431Z","draft_created_at":"2024-08-21T15:06:48.132441Z","lead_time":19.643,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"64c0f193-ac81-434d-baf9-dfb9535d642c","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":19253,"project":46,"updated_by":6,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"5309fa93-task_9.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"I only tried the Arc’teryx in medium, but it didn’t matter because it fit perfectly.

Since to date these lines of work progressed largely in parallel (with notable exceptions), we are interested in investigating the intersection: probing for reasoning about the implicitly-held knowledge. Suspecting the performance to be lacking in this area, we use a very simple set-up of comparisons between cardinalities associated with elements of various subjects (e.g. the number of legs a bird has versus the number of wheels on a tricycle). We empirically demonstrate that although LLMs make steady progress in knowledge acquisition and (pseudo)reasoning with each new GPT release, their capabilities are limited to statistical inference only. It is difficult to argue that pure statistical learning can cope with the combinatorial explosion inherent in many commonsense reasoning tasks, especially once arithmetical notions are involved.

The bottoms have a flattering high-waist cut but are a little cheeky, too. One thing to note — the bottoms hit below the belly button (which is accurate to the product pictures), so they won’t fit exactly at the waistline, if that’s what you’re looking for. Also, the top runs a little tight, so those with a larger cup size may want to size up. — Sophie Shaw, associate fashion and beauty editor","translation":"这款比基尼在风格、功能性、遮盖度和一丝性感之间达到了极佳的平衡。面料采用双层设计，无透视效果，更加有支撑力，我非常喜欢。单肩设计超级可爱，搭配侧边细节的系带，格外迷人。下装采用修身高腰设计，既显瘦又稍带性感。需要留意的是，下装下摆略低于肚脐（符合产品图片），因此不会完全贴在腰线处，如果您喜欢这种风格的话。此外，上装略显紧身，罩杯较大的人可能需要选择更大一码。 — Sophie Shaw，时尚与美容副主编","src":"cnn-news","idx":339,"type":"gpt-3.5-turbo_ctx_pivot","src_v1":"cnn","words_num":139,"batch_idx":161},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-08-20T10:29:29.859341Z","updated_at":"2024-08-22T14:07:17.780675Z","inner_id":162,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":46,"updated_by":6,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":19379,"annotations":[{"id":7110,"completed_by":6,"result":[{"value":{"start":241,"end":269,"text":"使用之前用户数据进行算法初始化可以用来明显加快学习过程。","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"OMy_eSlbhp","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":272,"end":305,"text":"算法初始化方法对参与者是否收敛到每个机器人状态相似的声音有很大影响","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"N85pUq821U","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":309,"end":335,"text":"音高偏移对用户对声音和机器人状态的关联有最大的影响。","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"-Fd2JocLrq","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":74,"end":119,"text":"我们探索通过调整非语言听觉表达（音高偏移、每分钟拍子数、每循环拍子数）来传递机器人功能状态","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"OFb4e5q9rr","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-08-22T14:08:30.357103Z","updated_at":"2024-08-26T16:07:09.000044Z","draft_created_at":"2024-08-22T14:08:11.185697Z","lead_time":81.846,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"0de666f8-a200-4281-bb5a-b05eea6fa873","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":19379,"project":46,"updated_by":6,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"5309fa93-task_9.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"Collaborative robots must effectively communicate their internal state to humans to enable a smooth interaction.
