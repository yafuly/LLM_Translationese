Further, we argue that bigger is not always better and chasing purely statistical improvements is flawed at the core, since it only exacerbates the dangerous conflation of the production of correct answers with genuine reasoning ability.","translation":"在大语言模型时代，对LLMs了解的领域和它们是否能够推理（或者说，近似推理）的问题是两个主要关注点。迄今为止，这些研究方向基本上是相对独立发展（尽管也有显著的例外），我们对探索交叉点感兴趣：考察隐含知识的推理能力。怀疑在这一领域表现欠佳，我们采用了非常简单的比较设置，对不同主题元素的基数进行比较（例如，一只鸟有几条腿与三轮车上的车轮数）。我们经验性地证明，尽管LLMs在每次新的GPT发布中在知识获取和（伪）推理方面取得稳步进展，但它们的能力仅限于统计推断。很难认为纯粹的统计学习可以应对许多常识推理任务中固有的组合爆炸，尤其是一旦涉及到算术概念。此外，我们认为，追求纯粹的统计改进并不总是更好，因为这样做在根源上是有缺陷的，它只会加剧正确答案的产出与真正推理能力之间的危险混淆。","src":"arxiv-ai","idx":1,"type":"gpt-3.5-turbo_ctx_pivot","src_v1":"arxiv","words_num":217,"batch_idx":89},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-08-20T10:28:47.366436Z","updated_at":"2024-08-22T05:23:50.334854Z","inner_id":90,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":44,"updated_by":14,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":18947,"annotations":[{"id":6895,"completed_by":14,"result":[{"value":{"start":11,"end":28,"text":"——是我男朋友给我妈妈买的圣诞礼物","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"daGNlqCHPa","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":39,"end":56,"text":"但对笔记本电脑的“空洞”音质很反感","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"WpgrYgUHi4","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":57,"end":75,"text":"这款语音控制音箱显然不仅仅是播放音乐","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"FyLocm3d8t","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":126,"end":132,"text":"完美融入空间","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"kbzhCn-2rA","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":170,"end":184,"text":"她最多就是用它来播放爵士音乐","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"z60QzcJOl9","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":141,"end":154,"text":"我教她如何使用它作为计时器","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"HOpwxwa7XC","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-08-22T07:04:43.327142Z","updated_at":"2024-08-22T07:13:24.211248Z","draft_created_at":"2024-08-22T06:45:19.133104Z","lead_time":6117.2080000000005,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"4c77475d-6594-4055-ae3a-d7e3b7311b4c","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":18947,"project":44,"updated_by":14,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"cc342828-task_9.json","drafts":[{"id":6751,"user":"xxx","created_username":"xxx, 3","created_ago":"1 day","result":[{"value":{"start":11,"end":28,"text":"——是我男朋友给我妈妈买的圣诞礼物","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"daGNlqCHPa","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":39,"end":56,"text":"但对笔记本电脑的“空洞”音质很反感","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"WpgrYgUHi4","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":57,"end":75,"text":"这款语音控制音箱显然不仅仅是播放音乐","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"FyLocm3d8t","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":126,"end":132,"text":"完美融入空间","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"kbzhCn-2rA","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":170,"end":184,"text":"她最多就是用它来播放爵士音乐","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"z60QzcJOl9","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":141,"end":154,"text":"我教她如何使用它作为计时器","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"HOpwxwa7XC","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"lead_time":6140.006,"was_postponed":false,"import_id":null,"created_at":"2024-08-26T06:34:32.879910Z","updated_at":"2024-08-26T06:34:32.879943Z","task":18947,"annotation":6895}],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"I can’t take credit for this one — my boyfriend got my mom this for Christmas.

Best of luck.","translation":"每日总食量将根据年龄和体重显示在包装袋上。您应该每天喂您的小狗四次（将每日总量除以4）。不要在两餐之间喂食；大约20分钟后收起食盆。当然，随着年龄和体重的增加，每日总食量也会增加。您的小狗大概在4到5个月大的时候可以减少到每天三次（将每日总量除以3），到了大约9个月大时可以减少到每天两次（将每日总量除以2）。之后继续维持每天两次。您是否给您的成年狗喂食了适量？如果您能看见它的肋骨，那么应该增加食物量。如果您摸不到它的肋骨，那么应该减少食物量。以上所说的都是我的计划。祝您好运。","src":"quora_foods","idx":471,"type":"gpt-4-turbo_end2end","src_v1":"quora","words_num":149,"batch_idx":125},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-08-20T10:28:47.371786Z","updated_at":"2024-08-22T10:09:55.448112Z","inner_id":126,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":44,"updated_by":14,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":18983,"annotations":[{"id":6957,"completed_by":14,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":36,"text":"但如果我发现他们的桌上其他人都已经吃了半边菜，而他们却在拿菜盘来回搬动菜","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"GfXorRBT5g","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":168,"end":170,"text":"检查","labels":["Unnatural Phrase Flow"]},"id":"EbONkN6W3v","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-08-22T10:12:48.479471Z","updated_at":"2024-08-22T10:12:53.845359Z","draft_created_at":"2024-08-22T10:10:56.370632Z","lead_time":151.71599999999998,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"1ce03d81-180d-4f37-8d10-ddb1eddb392a","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":18983,"project":44,"updated_by":14,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"cc342828-task_9.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"However, if I notice that the rest of their party is halfway done with their meals, while they’re moving the food around the plate?

Nonverbal communication is widely used to communicate information during human-robot interaction, however, such methods may also be misunderstood, leading to communication errors. In this work, we explore modulating the acoustic parameter values (pitch bend, beats per minute, beats per loop) of nonverbal auditory expressions to convey functional robot states (accomplished, progressing, stuck). We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm based on noisy human feedback to produce accurately interpreted nonverbal auditory expressions. The proposed approach was evaluated through a user study with 24 participants. The results demonstrate that: 1. Our proposed RL-based approach is able to learn suitable acoustic parameter values which improve the users' ability to correctly identify the state of the robot. 2. Algorithm initialization informed by previous user data can be used to significantly speed up the learning process. 3.
