He has maintained his innocence and denied any nonconsensual sexual activity.","translation":"纽约上诉法院周四推翻了针对好莱坞制片人哈维·韦恩斯坦的性犯罪定罪，这位强大的好莱坞制片人的崩溃曾被视为“#MeToo”运动的象征。法院下令重新进行审判，指出不应允许使用“先前不当行为”证人证词。这一裁决在性侵幸存者社区中引发了轩然大波，尤其是那些指控韦恩斯坦性侵和骚扰的100多名女性。现年72岁的韦恩斯坦早前因一级刑事性行为和三级强奸罪在2020年被定罪，被判处23年监禁。他一直坚称自己清白，并否认从事任何未经对方同意的性行为。","src":"cnn-news","idx":256,"type":"gpt-3.5-turbo_ctx_pivot","src_v1":"cnn","words_num":121,"batch_idx":17},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-08-20T10:29:06.776291Z","updated_at":"2024-08-20T14:03:53.526275Z","inner_id":18,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":45,"updated_by":11,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":19055,"annotations":[{"id":6669,"completed_by":11,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":35,"text":"Allbirds最新推出了悦动生活的运动鞋，轻盈得你几乎感觉不到脚上。","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"l2p_NyDUbc","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":35,"end":92,"text":"Tree Runner Go型号针对男女分别推出，精心提升了畅销款Tree Runner鞋款，加入了一些提升设计。","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"FIs7NzJaAF","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":92,"end":110,"text":"采用Tencel莫代尔树纤维材料制成","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"_xFPvvo2va","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":134,"end":155,"text":"比其他Allbirds鞋款更耐久可达20倍","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"_ijg8rFYIO","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":156,"end":183,"text":"成为日常购物、接送孩子上学及与Fido散步的理想选择。","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"CmMNcuK3zE","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-08-21T11:03:14.004628Z","updated_at":"2024-08-21T11:03:14.004672Z","draft_created_at":"2024-08-21T11:02:40.109942Z","lead_time":94.501,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"2f2c8b2c-0236-4bbd-bc7c-3909d0e9f44a","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":19055,"project":45,"updated_by":11,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"deecdfc2-task_9.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"The latest lifestyle sneakers from Allbirds are here, and they’re so light you’ll barely feel it on your feet.

However, Athenian orators faced serious structural obstacles. First, there was a rule that individuals were supposed to plead their own cases, which was soon bypassed by the increasing tendency of individuals to ask a \"friend\" for assistance. However, around the middle of the fourth century, the Athenians disposed of the perfunctory request for a friend. Second, a more serious obstacle, which the Athenian orators never completely overcame, was the rule that no one could take a fee to plead the cause of another. This law was widely disregarded in practice, but was never abolished, which meant that orators could \"never\" present themselves as legal professionals or experts. They had to uphold the legal fiction that they were merely an ordinary citizen generously helping out a friend for free, and thus they could never organize into a real profession.

And these classic running shorts have all the right features: The lightweight woven fabric is sweat-wicking and fast-drying; mesh details for ventilation make an already breathable material even breezier; the hem is curved to cut down on fabric and allow for freedom of motion; there’s a built-in brief liner; and an internal drawstring in the waistband lets you fine-tune the fit. The 3-inch length might be a little short for some runners, and we would have preferred a slightly wider and higher waistband, but you’re getting a lot of tech for a very accessible price in these. Plus, they’re available in 10 colors on Under Armour’s site.","translation":"Under Armour的Fly-By短裤常被列入“最佳”榜单，主要得益于它的性价比难以匹敌。这款经典跑步短裤拥有你需要的一切优质特性：轻盈的编织面料不仅吸汗快干，还通过网眼设计增强通风，让透气材质更加舒适清爽；弧形的下摆设计减少了布料的使用，保证了运动时的自由度；集成的简洁内裤以及腰带内的调节绳，让你能够精确调整贴合度。3英寸的裤长对一些跑者来说可能稍微有点短，而我们也倾向于腰带能稍宽且高一些，但以这个价格，你能得到的高科技含量实在是超值。此外，这些短裤在Under Armour官网提供10种颜色选择。","src":"cnn-news","idx":258,"type":"gpt-4-turbo_ctx_pivot","src_v1":"cnn","words_num":154,"batch_idx":80},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-08-20T10:29:06.783381Z","updated_at":"2024-08-26T06:31:11.592477Z","inner_id":81,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":45,"updated_by":11,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":19118,"annotations":[{"id":6732,"completed_by":11,"result":[{"value":{"start":123,"end":139,"text":"我们怀疑在这一领域的表现可能不足","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"cZOLBW3if3","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":90,"end":95,"text":"显著的例外","labels":["Unnatural Phrase Flow"]},"id":"z2K2NI9b7T","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":175,"end":190,"text":"鸟的腿的数量与三轮车的轮子数量","labels":["Unnatural Phrase Flow"]},"id":"xPYgIV4Oha","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":259,"end":289,"text":"很难说纯粹的统计学习能够应对许多常识推理任务中固有的组合爆炸","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"9-jm6U4fOL","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-08-21T14:31:35.012827Z","updated_at":"2024-08-26T06:32:02.489986Z","draft_created_at":"2024-08-21T14:28:57.139145Z","lead_time":657.469,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"a9ed4cae-fbb2-448f-8249-1a9fbabe057f","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":19118,"project":45,"updated_by":11,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"deecdfc2-task_9.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"Two major areas of interest in the era of Large Language Models regard questions of what do LLMs know, and if and how they may be able to reason (or rather, approximately reason).
