So, if your mom’s due for an upgrade, have a good conversation up front about the photos she takes and how far she takes them from her subjects. My mom’s love of a good landscape photo deserves a better zoom, and I look forward to fixing that down the line. — Henry T. Casey, electronics writer","translation":"亲爱的读者，向我学习吧。不要因为你的父母可能不追求速度，就觉得他们不想拥有最新iPhone的更先进版本。我妈妈耐心等待着升级她的iPhone 8 Plus，今年终于发现真的有必要了。经过简短的交流后，我（错误地）给她推荐了基础版的iPhone 15。在她第一个周末体验这部手机时，我立刻发现了我此前未曾考虑到的问题。iPhone 15只提供原生的0.5倍和2倍变焦选项，而漏掉了iPhone 15 Pro和iPhone 15 Pro Max中提供的3倍和5倍变焦选项。所以，如果你妈妈需要升级，务必提前与她好好商量，了解她拍摄照片的习惯以及与拍摄对象的距离。我妈妈对美景照片的热爱应该得到更好的变焦效果，我期待在未来解决这个问题。 — 亨利·T·凯西，电子产品撰稿人","src":"cnn-news","idx":398,"type":"gpt-3.5-turbo_ctx_pivot","src_v1":"cnn","words_num":194,"batch_idx":89},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-07-16T05:09:20.863241Z","updated_at":"2024-07-17T13:35:14.822480Z","inner_id":90,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":15,"updated_by":6,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":14933,"annotations":[{"id":2536,"completed_by":6,"result":[{"value":{"start":11,"end":22,"text":"�ент camps ","labels":["Non-output"]},"id":"4RrCL2NNmp","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":59,"end":60,"text":"由","labels":["Unnatural Phrase Flow"]},"id":"EgZ5ezva1X","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":215,"end":254,"text":"抗议者声称他们希望他们的学校站在他们认为是 Gazza 中的种族灭绝的反对面。","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"3Jv9bAgqzC","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-07-17T13:36:21.632517Z","updated_at":"2024-07-17T13:36:21.632549Z","draft_created_at":"2024-07-17T13:35:33.369285Z","lead_time":35.573,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"399783ee-03b9-4c84-9f88-78bf69f81540","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":14933,"project":15,"updated_by":6,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"7d586e75-task_1.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"Students inside campus encampments that have spread across the United States over the past week are from a variety of backgrounds — including Palestinians, Arabs, Jews and Muslims, joined by students of other religious and ethnic backgrounds.

However, recent studies have indicated that the visual information provided by existing MMT datasets is insufficient, causing models to disregard it and overestimate their capabilities. This issue presents a significant obstacle to the development of MMT research. This paper presents a novel solution to this issue by introducing 3AM, an ambiguity-aware MMT dataset comprising 26,000 parallel sentence pairs in English and Chinese, each with corresponding images. Our dataset is specifically designed to include more ambiguity and a greater variety of both captions and images than other MMT datasets. We utilize a word sense disambiguation model to select ambiguous data from vision-and-language datasets, resulting in a more challenging dataset. We further benchmark several state-of-the-art MMT models on our proposed dataset. Experimental results show that MMT models trained on our dataset exhibit a greater ability to exploit visual information than those trained on other MMT datasets. Our work provides a valuable resource for researchers in the field of multimodal learning and encourages further exploration in this area.

However, recent studies have indicated that the visual information provided by existing MMT datasets is insufficient, causing models to disregard it and overestimate their capabilities. This issue presents a significant obstacle to the development of MMT research. This paper presents a novel solution to this issue by introducing 3AM, an ambiguity-aware MMT dataset comprising 26,000 parallel sentence pairs in English and Chinese, each with corresponding images. Our dataset is specifically designed to include more ambiguity and a greater variety of both captions and images than other MMT datasets. We utilize a word sense disambiguation model to select ambiguous data from vision-and-language datasets, resulting in a more challenging dataset. We further benchmark several state-of-the-art MMT models on our proposed dataset. Experimental results show that MMT models trained on our dataset exhibit a greater ability to exploit visual information than those trained on other MMT datasets.
