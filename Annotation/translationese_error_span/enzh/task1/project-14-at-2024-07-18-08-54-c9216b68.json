Third, through human evaluation, we find that the performance of strong models is comparable to the human level regarding semantic phrase processing. Our benchmarking findings can serve future research aiming to improve the generic capability of LMs on semantic phrase comprehension. Our source code and data are available at https:\/\/github.com\/jacklanda\/LexBench","translation":"我们介绍了LexBench，一个全面的评估套件，可以测试语言模型（LMs）在十个语义短语处理任务上的表现。与以往的研究不同，这是第一个从比较的角度提出框架来建模一般语义短语（即词汇搭配）和三种细粒度的语义短语，包括习语表达、名词复合和动词结构。借助我们的基准，我们评估了15个LMs在模型架构和参数规模上在分类、提取和解释任务中的性能。通过实验，我们首先验证了缩放定律，并发现，如预期的那样，大型模型在大多数任务中表现更好。其次，我们通过缩放语义关系分类进一步调查，发现少样本LMs在任务中仍然落后于普通微调模型。第三，通过人类评估，我们发现强模型的性能在语义短语处理方面与人类水平可比。我们的基准结果可以为未来的研究提供帮助，旨在提高LMs在语义短语理解方面的通用能力。我们的源代码和数据可在https:\/\/github.com\/jacklanda\/LexBench获取。","src":"arxiv-ai","idx":0,"type":"gpt-3.5-turbo_end2end","src_v1":"arxiv","words_num":206},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-07-15T13:51:52.292235Z","updated_at":"2024-07-17T08:01:36.782427Z","inner_id":27,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":14,"updated_by":11,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":14510,"annotations":[{"id":2226,"completed_by":11,"result":[{"value":{"start":60,"end":71,"text":"结果吃起来有些水分多了","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"XL9byg0lev","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":189,"end":194,"text":"我们被告知","labels":["Unnatural Phrase Flow"]},"id":"0148ZnaWF7","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":195,"end":221,"text":"他们一直在渴望混合饼干，因为没有人愿意为他们混合饼干","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"fwrb7GKW-T","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":161,"end":171,"text":"但是混合好的感觉真好","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"3Risv-BmKw","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-07-16T05:36:14.138444Z","updated_at":"2024-07-18T01:35:07.522654Z","draft_created_at":"2024-07-16T05:35:02.061315Z","lead_time":174.136,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"b3e43df3-5d22-4835-8681-fef632007d07","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":14510,"project":14,"updated_by":11,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"891dae1b-task_1.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"I’d never pureed a pizza before, so we cut the hot pizza into pieces, threw it into a two gallon container, poured in some water and let her rip.

Based on the survey of the Jaffna population by the BBC and Reuters journalists, a U.S. diplomatic cable from 1994 stated that support for the LTTE was fairly strong among the Jaffna population who admired the discipline of the LTTE's administrative service, and that majority of Jaffna residents would choose the LTTE over the Sri Lankan Army given the choice. According to the assessments by independent observers, the LTTE administration of justice gained \"significant social acceptance\", and its courts were broadly seen as \"more efficient, less expensive, and less vulnerable to corruption than their Sri Lankan counterparts.\" The LTTE police force also had \"a high degree of legitimacy\" among Tamil civilians who viewed it as \"an uncorrupt and important stabilizing factor in the region.\" A survey carried out by the Centre for Policy Alternatives in 2002 from a sample of 89 Sri Lankan Tamils found that 89% regarded the LTTE as their sole representatives.

Despite their excellent generation performance, they are challenging to infer in real time due to the multi-step sampling mechanism that involves tens or hundreds of repeat function evaluation iterations. To this end, we investigate a motion latent consistency Training (MLCT) for motion generation to alleviate the computation and time consumption during iteration inference. It applies diffusion pipelines to low-dimensional motion latent spaces to mitigate the computational burden of each function evaluation. Explaining the diffusion process with probabilistic flow ordinary differential equation (PF-ODE) theory, the MLCT allows extremely few steps infer between the prior distribution to the motion latent representation distribution via maintaining consistency of the outputs over the trajectory of PF-ODE. Especially, we introduce a quantization constraint to optimize motion latent representations that are bounded, regular, and well-reconstructed compared to traditional variational constraints. Furthermore, we propose a conditional PF-ODE trajectory simulation method, which improves the conditional generation performance with minimal additional training costs.
