Despite being in its nascent stages, this emerging field grapples with nebulous concepts and intricate knowledge frameworks. By analyzing three prevailing concepts - explainable AI, trustworthy AI, and ethical AI, this study defined responsible AI and identified its core principles. Methodologically, this study successfully demonstrated the implementation of leveraging AI's capabilities into bibliometrics for enhanced knowledge discovery and the cross-validation of experimentally examined models with domain insights. Empirically, this study investigated 17,799 research articles contributed by the AI community since 2015.

As for the institutional changes, a decrease in union power and a declining real minimum wage, which both reduce unskilled workers wages, and tax cuts for the wealthy all increase the inequality gap between groups of earners.","translation":"在劳动经济学的背景下，不平等通常指的是家庭间收入分配的不均。经济学家通常用基尼系数来衡量不平等程度。这一系数没有具体的含义，更多的是用作比较不同地区之间的不平等情况。基尼系数计算得越高，该地区的不平等现象就越严重。随着时间的推移，平均而言，不平等现象有所增加。这是由于包括劳动力供需变化以及劳动市场的制度变革等多种因素所致。在劳动力供需变化方面，包括对熟练工人的需求增加超过熟练工人的供给，并且相对于非熟练工人而言，以及提高生产率的技术变革；所有这些因素都导致熟练劳动者的工资上涨，而非熟练工人的工资保持不变或下降。至于制度变化，工会力量的减弱和实际最低工资的下降都会降低非熟练工人的工资，而对富裕阶层的税收减免则加剧了各收入群体之间的不平等差距。","src":"wiki","idx":760,"type":"gpt-4-turbo_end2end","src_v1":"wiki","words_num":204,"batch_idx":80},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-08-08T02:05:43.949940Z","updated_at":"2024-08-08T13:22:06.981372Z","inner_id":81,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":35,"updated_by":14,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":17318,"annotations":[{"id":5130,"completed_by":14,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":12,"text":"为了在生活中做出一份贡献","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"BXMpAGKV7Y","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":13,"end":32,"text":"他在那格浦尔市开始了货车司机的职业生涯","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"QlM-AN8iDb","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":32,"end":48,"text":"，并且他的兄弟们也一同参与其中。","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"tvNbiR9ZH5","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":48,"end":58,"text":"只是为了避免被人认出","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"EgatxPKCab","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":83,"end":90,"text":"租赁的房子里。","labels":["Unnatural Phrase Flow"]},"id":"gofsBocbcD","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":90,"end":105,"text":"早先他曾担任一家公司的货车司机","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"6VShZpheM1","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":119,"end":134,"text":"并且通过向银行借款获得了资金。","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"rcsf625ukB","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":137,"end":148,"text":"命运却安排了不同的结局","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"jZgXt1gXhd","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":161,"end":169,"text":"他遭遇了一场车祸","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"eWzrrWzJoY","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":170,"end":181,"text":"他在医院里度过了几天，","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"l05EEmxd4t","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":195,"end":220,"text":"他的右腿被截去了。这发生在1990年11月28日。","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"dDbCW8v8Xj","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-08-08T13:24:31.156607Z","updated_at":"2024-08-08T13:24:31.156654Z","draft_created_at":"2024-08-08T13:22:38.056869Z","lead_time":137.715,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"9ce99432-c422-4a59-bafc-64b22fc1d0a3","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":17318,"project":35,"updated_by":14,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"69557cf7-task_6.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"\"To make the bread of his life, he started aghast his career as a Truck Driver along with his brothers in Nagpur.

However, successful offline RL often relies heavily on the coverage and quality of the given dataset. In scenarios where the dataset for a specific task is limited, a natural approach is to improve offline RL with datasets from other tasks, namely, to conduct Multi-Task Data Sharing (MTDS). Nevertheless, directly sharing datasets from other tasks exacerbates the distribution shift in offline RL. In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-based MTDS approach that shares the entire dataset without data selection. Given ensemble-based uncertainty quantification, we perform pessimistic value iteration on the shared offline dataset, which provides a unified framework for single- and multi-task offline RL. We further provide theoretical analysis, which shows that the optimality gap of our method is only related to the expected data coverage of the shared dataset, thus resolving the distribution shift issue in data sharing.

Synthetic results can be viewed at https:\/\/github.com\/X-LANCE\/AniTalker.","translation":"本文介绍了AniTalker，这是一个创新型框架，设计用于从单张肖像生成栩栩如生的说话面孔。不同于那些主要关注唇部同步等语言线索，却未能捕捉到面部表情和非言语线索复杂动态的现有模型，AniTalker采用了一种通用运动表征。该表征有效捕捉了广泛的面部动态，包括细微的表情和头部运动。AniTalker通过两种自监督学习策略来增强运动描述：第一种策略是在相同身份的源帧与目标视频帧之间重建来学习细微的运动表征；第二种策略通过度量学习开发身份编码器，并积极地最小化身份与运动编码器之间的相互信息。这种方法确保了运动表征既是动态的，又不含身份特定详情，显著减少了对标注数据的依赖。此外，集成了一种扩散模型和方差适配器，使得生成的面部动画既多样化又可控。这种方法不仅证明了AniTalker在创造细致、逼真的面部动作方面的能力，也突显了其在为现实世界应用制作动态头像的潜力。合成结果可以在https:\/\/github.com\/X-LANCE\/AniTalker查看。","src":"arxiv-ai","idx":41,"type":"gpt-4-turbo_ctx_pivot","src_v1":"arxiv","words_num":208,"batch_idx":134},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-08-08T02:05:43.955978Z","updated_at":"2024-08-09T08:43:50.368123Z","inner_id":135,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":35,"updated_by":14,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":17372,"annotations":[{"id":5384,"completed_by":14,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":12,"text":"工會的小而強大的工作人員","labels":["Unnatural Phrase Flow"]},"id":"KOQgYI_oOX","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":39,"end":77,"text":"我們出色的學生們也努力在星期一晚上為一個有意義的逾越節晚餐在我們的庭院裡布置","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"PekvysF6mx","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":90,"end":95,"text":"主理的服務","labels":["Unnatural Phrase Flow"]},"id":"1BWuLyCX01","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":96,"end":112,"text":"讓在場的我們重獲社區的那份感覺。","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"uDDl8B9vhu","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":134,"end":145,"text":"以及信仰靈性但不宗教的","labels":["Unnatural Phrase Flow"]},"id":"hZtYYOmpi7","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":166,"end":171,"text":"真是美妙。","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"zptgvk4Ter","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":171,"end":201,"text":"他們一起舉行了一個像全世界各地正在舉行的逾越節晚餐一樣的晚餐","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"6-T7gQMeMX","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":206,"end":212,"text":"有寧靜的沉思","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"3qXm7mHr4O","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-08-09T08:47:02.221516Z","updated_at":"2024-08-09T08:47:02.221551Z","draft_created_at":"2024-08-09T08:45:00.529115Z","lead_time":118.235,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"9e847981-8e03-4a14-becd-f404a48c7c69","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":17372,"project":35,"updated_by":14,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"69557cf7-task_6.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"Union’s small but mighty staff put tremendous effort into working out all the logistics so we could make this happen, and our wonderful students worked hard to set up our courtyard on Monday evening for a meaningful Passover seder.
