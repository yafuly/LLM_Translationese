Inequality is commonly measured by economists using the Gini coefficient. This coefficient does not have a concrete meaning but is more used as a way to compare inequality across regions. The higher the Gini coefficient is calculated to be the larger inequality exists in a region. Over time, inequality has, on average, been increasing. This is due to numerous factors including labour supply and demand shifts as well as institutional changes in the labour market. On the shifts in labour supply and demand, factors include demand for skilled workers going up more than the supply of skilled workers and relative to unskilled workers as well as technological changes that increase productivity; all of these things cause wages to go up for skilled labour while unskilled worker wages stay the same or decline.

Within this paradigm, the Knowledge Graph (KG) emerges as a crucial element, offering a structured and dynamic method for representing knowledge through interconnected entities and relationships, predominantly utilizing the triple (subject, predicate, object). This paper explores recent advancements in neural-symbolic integration based on KG, elucidating how KG underpins this integration across three key categories: enhancing the reasoning and interpretability of neural networks through the incorporation of symbolic knowledge (Symbol for Neural), refining the completeness and accuracy of symbolic systems via neural network methodologies (Neural for Symbol), and facilitating their combined application in Hybrid Neural-Symbolic Integration. It highlights current trends and proposes directions for future research in the domain of Neural-Symbolic AI.","translation":"在人工智能（AI）领域，特别是通过深度神经网络（DNN）的迅速发展，许多领域都取得了巨大进步。然而，开发出具有人类智能的智能系统，尤其是能够理解人类的意图，仍然是一个严峻挑战。符号系统与神经系统的结合，即通过简单的符号系统来实现神经系统的扩展性和复杂性，是构建更加透明和易于理解的AI系统的重要途径。在这一途径下，知识图谱（KG）发挥了重要作用，它通过对关系和对象的连接，以及三元组（主语、动词、宾语）为主的知识表示方式，把知识构建在一个结构化和动态的网络中。本文总结了在KG框架下，神经系统与符号系统的结合所取得的最新进展，并介绍了该领域的三个主要发展趋势：通过将符号知识与神经网络结合，提升神经网络的理解力和可解释性；通过神经网络的方法来优化符号系统，增强符号系统的完整性和准确性；以及将两者结合用于混合式神经系统的构建。文中还对该领域的最新研究进展进行了介绍，并对未来的研究趋势进行了展望。","src":"arxiv-ai","idx":34,"type":"alma_7B_trans","src_v1":"arxiv","words_num":214,"batch_idx":116},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-08-08T02:06:09.830928Z","updated_at":"2024-08-09T03:07:38.564462Z","inner_id":117,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":36,"updated_by":11,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":17534,"annotations":[{"id":5261,"completed_by":11,"result":[{"value":{"start":34,"end":48,"text":"对与年轻领导人的谈判不再开放","labels":["Unnatural Phrase Flow"]},"id":"w1X0zpchf7","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":110,"end":113,"text":"再选举","labels":["Unnatural Phrase Flow"]},"id":"oIybQhvW5B","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":114,"end":127,"text":"并且在展示美国支持的情况下","labels":["Mistranslations"]},"id":"bVaAWY7rvS","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":190,"end":199,"text":"史无前例的首次会晤","labels":["Unnatural Phrase Flow"]},"id":"qVaKZ6UQrp","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":340,"end":367,"text":"他在1911年被推翻并被迫流亡法国，此后军队发动叛乱。","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"vUJDSOqze7","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":67,"end":98,"text":"这引发了广泛的感觉，似乎迪亚兹的时代即将结束，新的联盟必须建立","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"q_r8wRjNbP","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":71,"end":76,"text":"广泛的感觉","labels":["Unnatural Phrase Flow"]},"id":"wWLQgXcZKJ","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-08-09T06:08:44.218054Z","updated_at":"2024-08-09T06:50:32.401801Z","draft_created_at":"2024-08-09T05:58:55.245070Z","lead_time":10490.186,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"cace3a93-d8b3-47e5-81e2-2aa7db3d5a25","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":17534,"project":36,"updated_by":11,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"7df24b83-task_6.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"The political skills that Díaz used so effectively before 1900 faded, as he and his closest advisers were less open to negotiations with younger leaders.

Unlike existing models that primarily focus on verbal cues such as lip synchronization and fail to capture the complex dynamics of facial expressions and nonverbal cues, AniTalker employs a universal motion representation. This innovative representation effectively captures a wide range of facial dynamics, including subtle expressions and head movements. AniTalker enhances motion depiction through two self-supervised learning strategies: the first involves reconstructing target video frames from source frames within the same identity to learn subtle motion representations, and the second develops an identity encoder using metric learning while actively minimizing mutual information between the identity and motion encoders. This approach ensures that the motion representation is dynamic and devoid of identity-specific details, significantly reducing the need for labeled data. Additionally, the integration of a diffusion model with a variance adapter allows for the generation of diverse and controllable facial animations. This method not only demonstrates AniTalker's capability to create detailed and realistic facial movements but also underscores its potential in crafting dynamic avatars for real-world applications.
