The hook is flexible and adjustable (I prefer them to be a little looser so they don’t rub at the back of my ear during long-time wear), and I found the rubberlike material to be a little sleeker and softer than those on other earbuds I tested. I tend to opt for over-the-ear headphones instead of earbuds during races and longer runs because the hooks give me the option of popping an earbud out of my ear canal so I can hear my surroundings or have a conversation with another runner if I want to. I’ve even taken an earbud out and hooked it onto my sports bra — and I haven’t lost one yet.","translation":"Powerbeats Pro是全无线耳塞，可挂在耳朵上，在行动中保持固定。挂钩柔韧可调（我更偏向稍微宽松，长时间佩戴不会磨擦耳后部），橡胶般材质光滑柔软，比我测试的其他耳塞更为优雅。比赛和长跑时，我更倾向于戴挂耳头耳机而非耳塞，因为挂钩让我可以随意取下一个耳塞，聆听周遭或与他人交谈。我甚至曾将一个耳塞取下，挂在运动胸罩上，但从未弄丢过一个。","src":"cnn-news","idx":305,"type":"gpt-3.5-turbo_ctx_pivot","src_v1":"cnn","words_num":151,"batch_idx":116},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-08-01T09:47:53.810964Z","updated_at":"2024-08-02T07:32:02.267516Z","inner_id":117,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":32,"updated_by":11,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":16814,"annotations":[{"id":4517,"completed_by":11,"result":[{"value":{"start":141,"end":154,"text":"与英国爆发战争成为不可避免","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"Vuetbc1YzV","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":178,"end":184,"text":"完全主张独立","labels":["Unnatural Phrase Flow"]},"id":"0JEPC7LakY","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":208,"end":220,"text":"美国很容易没有英国制造商","labels":["Unnatural Sentence Flow"]},"id":"Mf0JUY5PV6","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":299,"end":309,"text":"牺牲了每一项重要利益","labels":["Unnatural Phrase Flow"]},"id":"5EuCdhotnG","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-08-02T07:42:29.501508Z","updated_at":"2024-08-07T06:33:41.260303Z","draft_created_at":"2024-08-02T07:41:14.560133Z","lead_time":134.917,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"21d0df14-cf86-4875-b106-825edbbc5c42","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":16814,"project":32,"updated_by":11,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"a00a1123-task_5.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"With Jefferson out of office after 1793, Madison became the de facto leader of the Democratic–Republican Party.

These deep features extracted from multiple projection views of the PET volumes are then aggregated and fused, and employed to perform recurrence-free survival analysis on a cohort of 489 HNC patients. The proposed approach outperforms the best performing method on the target dataset for the task of recurrence-free survival analysis. By circumventing the manual delineation of the malignancies on the FDG PET-CT images, our approach eliminates the dependency on subjective interpretations and highly enhances the reproducibility of the proposed survival analysis method.","translation":"我们提出了一种新型、简单、高效的头颈癌(HNC)患者术后预后预测方法，它通过采用深度学习(DL)基础的特征提取技术以及多角度最大值强度成像(MA-MIP)对功能成像(FDG-PET)成像数据进行处理，从而摆脱了对患者局部病灶和淋巴结的手动分割的需要。我们采用了一种最新的深度神经网络(DNN)前驱网络底层架构，以识别和提取从多角度角度的MA-MIP中获得的数据中的深度特征，从而进行预后分析。我们使用了一个已经预训练的DNN底层架构，对来自72个不同角度的MA-MIP的数据进行了自动裁剪，然后将裁剪后的数据进行汇总和融合，并用于对HNC患者术后预后进行分析。我们的方法在针对HNC患者的目标数据集上表现出了最佳的预后分析结果，这种方法比现有的最好的方法更具有可靠性和可重复性。通过避免对患者的局部病灶和淋巴结进行手动分割，我们的方法大大提高了术后预后分析的可靠性和可重复性。","src":"arxiv-ai","idx":113,"type":"alma_7B_trans","src_v1":"arxiv","words_num":212,"batch_idx":134},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-08-01T09:47:53.811988Z","updated_at":"2024-08-02T07:57:48.138480Z","inner_id":135,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":32,"updated_by":11,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":16832,"annotations":[{"id":4538,"completed_by":11,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":17,"text":"我喜欢认为我会尽量保持车内相对整洁","labels":["Unnatural Phrase Flow"]},"id":"dh9tAr9R9C","from_name":"label","to_name":"translation","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-08-02T08:05:52.250239Z","updated_at":"2024-08-02T08:06:03.957158Z","draft_created_at":"2024-08-02T08:05:32.807608Z","lead_time":60.202999999999996,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"06479128-71b0-45b1-b8c4-0edc5b9eebca","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":16832,"project":32,"updated_by":11,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"a00a1123-task_5.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"I like to think I keep my car relatively clutter-free, but that can change quickly.

To adapt TRAMBA to vibration-based sensing modalities, we pre-train TRAMBA with audio speech datasets that are widely available. Then, users fine-tune with a small amount of bone conduction data. TRAMBA outperforms state-of-art GANs by up to 7.3% in PESQ and 1.8% in STOI, with an order of magnitude smaller memory footprint and an inference speed up of up to 465 times.
