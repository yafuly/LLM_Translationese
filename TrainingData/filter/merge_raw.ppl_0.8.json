However, we're surprised to see that Himiko was located not in the center of the protocluster, but on the edge 500 million light-years away from the center.\" said Masami Ouchi, a team member at the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan and the University of Tokyo, who discovered Himiko in 2009.

        "input": "Auf der Weltkarte der Handelskriege stellen die Reibereien mit Indien freilich bloss einen Nebenschauplatz dar. Zudem betrachtet Amerika die weltgrösste Demokratie auch durch die sicherheitspolitische Brille. Delhi und Washington verbindet die Sorge über Chinas Machtansprüche im Südindischen Ozean. Vor diesem Hintergrund mutet eine Salve amerikanischer Strafzölle gegen Indien unwahrscheinlich an. Indiens Premierminister Narendra Modi, der soeben eine zweite fünfjährige Amtszeit angetreten hat, dürfte sich deshalb in Sicherheit wiegen.",
        "output": "On the world map of the trade war, the friction with India is little more than a sideshow. Moreover, America sees the world's largest democracy through the lens of a security policy. Delhi and Washington are united in their concern over China's claims to power in the southern Indian Ocean. This makes a volley of American tariffs against India appear unlikely. So India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who just entered his second five-year term, can feel safe.",

Beim kabellosen Aufladen haben die Forscher selbst bei perfekter Ausrichtung des Smartphones auf dem Ladepad hingegen stets über 30 Grad gemessen. Liegt das Handy etwas neben der Spule, steigt die Temperatur noch höher. Darüber hinaus steigt dabei auch die Wattstärke des Ladepads, was wiederum den Stromverbrauch in die Höhe treibt.",

But with wireless charging, researchers measured over 86 degrees even if the smartphone was perfectly aligned on the charging pad. If the cell phone is placed near the coil, the temperature is even higher. Moreover, the wattage of the charging pad increases, which in turn jacks up the use of power.",

        "input": "Ich bin nicht der Meinung, dass de Grood jemals dauerhaft unbeaufsichtigt sein sollte. Ein Bewährungssystem, bei dem er sich melden muss, um sicherzustellen, dass er seine Medikamente noch nimmt, könnte gut funktionieren. Das Argument, dass er oder andere psychisch kranke Menschen in einer Anstalt bleiben sollten, selbst wenn es nicht absolut notwendig ist, ist eine Form der Abgrenzung. Dies führt die Idee fort, dass psychisch kranke Menschen, insbesondere solche mit Schizophrenie, sich niemals in die Gesellschaft einfügen können; dadurch wird das Stigma fortgesetzt und die Vorstellung, dass sie gefährliche Kriminelle sind, aufrechterhalten. Ein Gericht befand ihn für nicht strafrechtlich verantwortlich, also warum sollte er also wie ein Gefangener behandelt werden, statt wie jemand, der krank war und dem es jetzt besser geht?",
        "output": "I don't believe de Grood should ever be unsupervised permanently. A parole-like system where he has to check in to make sure he's still taking his medication could work well. Arguing that he or other mentally ill people remain institutionalized unless absolutely necessary is a form of segregation. It perpetuates the idea that mentally ill people, those with schizophrenia in particular, cannot ever mesh with society; thus continuing the stigma and perpetuating the idea that they are dangerous criminals. He was found not criminally responsible by a court of law, so why should he be treated like a prisoner instead of someone who was ill and is now better?",

Allerdings sind wir überrascht, dass sich Himiko nicht im Zentrum des Proto-Haufens, sondern am Rand der Galaxie, 500 Millionen Lichtjahre vom Zentrum entfernt, befand“, safte Masami Ouchi, ein Teammitglied bei der National Astronomical Observatory of Japan und der University of Tokyo, der Himiko im Jahr 2009 entdeckte. Ironischerweise wurde von der mythologischen Königin Himiko ebenfalls gesagt, dass sie von ihrem Volk abgekapselt gelebt haben soll. „Es ist immer noch nicht klar, wieso sich Himiko nicht im Zentrum befindet“, fährt Ouchi fort. „Diese Ergebnisse werden eine Schlüsselrolle dabei spielen, die Beziehung zwischen Haufen und massereichen Galaxien zu verstehen.“",

However, we're surprised to see that Himiko was located not in the center of the protocluster, but on the edge 500 million light-years away from the center.\" said Masami Ouchi, a team member at the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan and the University of Tokyo, who discovered Himiko in 2009. Ironically, the mythological queen Himiko is also said to have lived cloistered away from her people. Ouchi continues, \"It is still not understood why Himiko is not located in the center.

Im Februar erreichten 500 US-Soldaten den Militärstützpunkt in Rumänien. Eine Eurofighter Typhoon-Staffel der britischen Luftwaffe ist ebenfalls dort stationiert und einsatzbereit.

Es ist zwar kein Mitglied des Bündnisses, aber an Truppenübungen der NATO beteiligt. NATO-Generalsekretär Jens Stoltenberg teilte bei einem Besuch in Tiflis im März mit, dass die NATO Georgien auf den Beitritt „vorbereite“.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said during a visit to Tbilisi in March that the alliance was \"preparing\" Georgia for accession.
